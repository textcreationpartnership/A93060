            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A meditation never more needful to be ſtudied and practiſed, then in ſuch <hi>Naufragious</hi> times as theſe, wherein we have ſeen the <hi>Greateſt States</hi> in the

            <p>The windes and Sea were never more high and rough, nor the ſhip more Toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; the earth never more rent with Earthquakes, nor the world leſſe ſetled. What is to be done? There is a <hi>Fort</hi> that ſtandeth firme when <hi>the earth is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi> There is an <hi>Arke</hi> that ſwims a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft when the whole world is drowned, and the higheſt mountaines thrown into the midſt of the Sea: This <hi>Fort</hi> is <hi>Faith;</hi> This <hi>Arke</hi> is <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the goods to be gotten and made ſtore of in theſe dayes: Theſe make one truly rich, and ſafe and happy.

               <pb facs="tcp:169477:10"/> of his <hi>Tree,</hi> and <hi>gathering</hi> of the <hi>fruit:</hi> He I ſay, hath far more good by this Tree, than he that can learnedly in any language diſcourſe of it, and tell you the <hi>Phyſical</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fruit, and can exactly tell you his <hi>Age, Deſcent,</hi> and to an <hi>Inch</hi> give you his <hi>Thickneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Height,</hi> and tell you how many <hi>Twigs</hi> and <hi>Leaves</hi> there are upon it, and how much fruit to an <hi>Apple,</hi> but all this while it is none of his.</p>
            <p>So ſurely he is much the happier man, who though he fall ſhort in matter of <hi>parts,</hi> yet is he the man that lookes to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and minds that.</p>
            <p>Conſcience is the <hi>ſumme</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> matter, it is the <hi>Totum Dei,</hi> and the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Hominis</hi> too.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſcience is <hi>totum Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> It is the worlds great Charge: Art thou a <hi>Miniſter?</hi> All that thou haſt to doe, is onely to look well to Conſcience. <hi>Tota cura animarum abſolvitur in ſolâ curâ Conſcientiarum?</hi> Art thou a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> this is thy Charge, like his 1 King. 20. 39. Look well to this, ſee thy eye be never off it: Let it not break looſe and make eſcape from thee, thy life ſhall go for it if it do.</p>
            <p>To call Conſcience a <hi>Grace</hi> is too little, it is as <hi>Hegai</hi> the Kings <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> the <note place="margin">

            <p>To call Conſcience a <hi>Duty</hi> is too little, it is the <hi>Summe</hi> and <hi>Epitome</hi> of all duty; it is not a <hi>Star,</hi> but a <hi>Conſtellation</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtars.

            <p>In a word, what ever thou art, and what ever is thy work, Conſcience muſt be thy Charge and thy work.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe two Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that to <hi>Titus,</hi> may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Miniſters <hi>Directory,</hi> made up of <hi>Canons</hi> clearly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitately <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſter how to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> himſelfe and how to <hi>Guide</hi> his People.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters <hi>charge</hi> is looked upon by all as the greateſt; and the Apoſtle, who beſt knew what it was doth not ſpare to lay it home to him, and to give it him to the full.</p>
            <p>Each Miniſter hath a <hi>double</hi> charge. The one <hi>ad extra,</hi> concerning <hi>others.</hi> The other <hi>ad intra,</hi> which concernes <hi>himſelfe.</hi> Both are <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.</note> ſummed up in thoſe few words. 1 Tim. 4. 16.

            </p>
            <p>And you may ſee the Apoſtle through this Epiſtle doth frequently inculcate <hi>both,</hi> and doth ſtraightly charge both upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, As for that part of his charge <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> you may ſee it preſſed upon him. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. 4. and <hi>Chapter</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 13, 17, 20. <hi>Strict charges all,</hi> and ſo in the ſecond Epiſtle <hi>Paſſim.</hi> Whereby it appeares that the Miniſter, beſides thoſe things concerning himſelfe, ſtands charged with the care of the <hi>whole Churches</hi> buſineſſe, for what concernes both <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then for that other part. That <hi>ad intra,</hi> for what concernes himſelfe, and his owne Perſonall Demeanour. He hath his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Chapter, 4. 12, <hi>Be thou an example of the Beleevers in word, and in Converſation, in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Spirit, in Faith and Purity.</hi> And Chap. 6. 11, 12. <hi>But thou, O man of God fly theſe things, and follow after Righteouſneſſe, Godlineſſe, Faith, Love, Patience, Meekeneſſe. Fight the Good Fight of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Text is part of a <hi>Charge,</hi> as you ſee, v. 18. Yea it is a <hi>compendious ſumme</hi> of his whole <hi>double</hi> charge <hi>Tam ad intraquam ad extra,</hi> Both as to <hi>himſelfe</hi> and to his <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſe 18. A ſtraight charge is laid upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> This <hi>charge</hi> I <hi>commit to thee, that thou war a good warfare.]</hi> the Miniſters employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no other then a <hi>warfare,</hi> neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor worſe, A warfare <hi>no better.</hi> A good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169477:18"/> warefare, <hi>no worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This weighty charge is carryed home and Purſued. 1. With the <hi>affections</hi> of a <hi>Father.</hi> 2. With the arguments of an Apoſtle.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two arguments urged.</p>
            <p>1. The firſt is more <hi>Comfortable</hi> and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Timothy</hi> himſelfe, <hi>according to the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which went before of thee]</hi> There were ſome in thoſe dayes who had the gift of Prophecy, and could foretell things to come, ſome ſuch had given out great hopes of <hi>Timothy</hi> when he was young, and of his inſtrumentallneſſe to the Church, when he ſhould come to be put in employment. Now gracious and hopefull young men (in the Miniſtery eſpecially) muſt ſee to it, that what hopes, expectations and good opinions others have had of them, and what Prayers, Promiſes, and Engagements have beene made for them, may be all made good (not void) by them in the whole courſe of their life. Therefore Timothy, <hi>thou muſt war a good warfare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2, The other argument is <hi>more ſad:</hi> But reſpecteth <hi>others</hi> who had fearefully miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He inſtanceth in two, <hi>viz. Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> It is the ſame <hi>Hymeneus</hi> ſpoken of 2 Timothy 2. 17.

Acts, 19. 33. There you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169477:19"/> finde him in his beſt, but mentioned alſo, 2 Timothy, 4. 14, 15. There a man much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a deadly enemy to <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, for whom before he had ſo much appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a friend and Champion, both were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly faire Profeſſors, but now degenerated into <hi>foule Apoſtates,</hi> both of forward and (then hopefull) <hi>Diſciples</hi> now flown ſo high as to become too forward (but Dangerous) <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> even denying common received Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, as for inſtance; that Article of our faith concerning the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18, And broaching new, looſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Doctrines, whereby they blew up the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17, 18.</note> faith of ſuch as hearkned to them. 2 <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Whoſe black fowle and Tragick ſtory is here compendiouſly ſet downe in two verſes, 19, 20. and holds forth <hi>foure</hi> remarkable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages as touching them.

            <p>2. In the Perfection and Concluſion of it. They came at laſt to Blaſphem. The worſt end and concluſion that could be.</p>
            <p>Here is nothing but ſin in theſe 2 paſſages, and ſin upon ſin.</p>
            <p>In the two remaining there is nothing but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169477:19"/> judgement, <hi>judgement</hi> upon <hi>ſinne,</hi> and <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon <hi>judgement,</hi> a <hi>double</hi> judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>double</hi> ſinne. The one <hi>Divine</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret for their ſecret <hi>ſinne,</hi> they had put away good Conſcience. And they are ſhattered and ſhip-wracked in their faith, for their puniſhment. They having repudiated Conſcience, and given her a bill of divorce, preſently commit Adultery with prodigious Errors and Opinions. The late Engliſh Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the place is very good. <q rend="margQuotes">"<hi>That God doth puniſh men for giving raines to a licentious courſe of life, againſt the dictates of their owne Conſciences.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>judgement</hi> that befell them was <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>Open</hi> for their open ſinne in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing Blaſphemous aſſertions. It was the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> watching over their Members, who obſerving ſome to become ſo <hi>Putrid</hi> and <hi>infectious,</hi> as to endanger the whole body of the joyning Congregation, deliver theſe over <hi>judicially</hi> in a way of Church <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> to Sathan.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169477:43"/> and in an <hi>illegible</hi> character from thy mouth as faſt as thou ſpeakeſt, yea from thy heart what thou contriveſt; conſciences writing, at preſent is not legible; as that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the juyce of a Lemmon is not to be read by <hi>Day-light,</hi> but againſt the fire by night you may read it; ſo conſciences writing will be read by fire light of diſtreſs, or in that day when Heaven and earth are on fire, then ſhall this book be opened, and <hi>the Cypher</hi> be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Conſcience is the pooreſt mans <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer,</hi> who hath no <hi>Chronicler</hi> to write his Story.

It is not the lot of every mean man to have his Acts and memory perpetuated; it is the honour of Kings, and ſometimes of ſome other more eminent perſons; of <hi>David</hi> it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 29. Now the reſt of the Acts of <hi>David the King firſt and laſt,</hi> behold <hi>they are written in the Book of</hi> Samuel <hi>the Seer, and in the</hi> book <hi>of</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet, and in the Book of</hi> Gad <hi>the Seer.</hi> But of every man of whatſoever quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be ſaid, the reſt of his Acts though they be not mentioned in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings, yet firſt and laſt they are all written in the book of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of conſcience by <hi>Syneideſis the Seer,</hi> and <hi>Syntereſis the Recorder.</hi> Now to draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, conſcience I ſaid was then a good
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169477:44"/> conſcience when it doth diſcharge all his forenamed Offices. A <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a <hi>Judge,</hi> a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> is then good, when each of them is <hi>good</hi> in his proper <hi>place</hi> and <hi>functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and indeed that every one is in truth, which he is in diſcharge of his particular Calling: Then is conſcience good when it doth <hi>officiate</hi> well, and doth the part of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> of a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> of a <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> and of a <hi>Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe four teſpects, I may ſay of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Ipſa indicat, ipſa imperat, ipſa obſervat, ipſa judicat,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> excellently, <hi>Ipſa teſtis, ipſa judex, ipſa tortor, ipſa carcer. Ipſa accuſat,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A good conſcience is a good Miniſter, a good Magiſtrate, a good Witneſs, a good Judge, <hi>the beſt of friends;</hi> but an ill conſcience is an <hi>obſerver</hi> of thee, will be an <hi>informer</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, and both thine <hi>adverſary,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,</hi> and <hi>witneſs,</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and <hi>Executioner,</hi> and <hi>Tormentor</hi> too, <hi>the worſt of enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence flow five <hi>Corollaries,</hi> or concluſions.</p>
               <p>Corollary 1. <hi>Conſcience is to perform his two firſt Offices,</hi> viz. <hi>of a</hi> Miniſter <hi>to inform and direct, and of a King to</hi> command <hi>and preſcribe before a work is to be done, or when in fieri.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould call in Underſtanding and Faith to adviſe with; and herein imitate God, who <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. intending to Create Man, propounds his <hi>Action,</hi> propounds his <hi>End,</hi> and propounds his <hi>Model: Let us make</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:169477:44"/> 
                  <hi>man in our Image, after our likeneſſe, and let them have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the ayre, and over the cattell, and over all the earth &amp;c.</hi> So ſhould we ſay, Let me upon deliberation do ſuch an <hi>Act</hi> after ſuch a <hi>manner,</hi> to ſuch an <hi>end.</hi> This is to Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to conſcience, and conſequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God.</p>
               <p>Corollary 2. When a <hi>work or action is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, In facto eſſe,</hi> conſcience is to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his two laſt Offices of a witneſs, and of a Judge,</hi> to accuſe or excuſe, to approve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and ſo to paſſe ſentence. Thus did God after every dayes work finiſhed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed his worke, and ſaw with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and fulneſs of approbation, it was good; And at laſt, Gen. 1. 31. <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good:</hi> So ſhould we review all our actions before we paſſe from them to new buſineſſes. Let thine eyes <hi>look right on,</hi> and let <hi>thine eye-lids look ſtrait before thee;</hi> Ponder <hi>the path of thy feet,</hi> and let <hi>all thy ways be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Prov. 4. 25, 26. There you have theſe <hi>two rules,</hi> in the well <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>practiſing,</hi> whereof lies the chiefeſt buſineſſe of <hi>Practical</hi> conſcience.</p>
               <p>Coroll. 3. When a <hi>man goes wilfully againſt the two firſt Acts, or</hi> Offices <hi>of Conſcience;</hi> viz. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterall &amp; Regall; he commits the higheſt ſin, and draws on the greateſt guilt. Maxima viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Conſcientiae maximum peccatum.</hi> Ameſ. What made the ſin of the lapſed Angels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169477:45"/> but becauſe they went againſt a full and clear light of a fully informed conſcience, and divinely irradiated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Their ſin had many <hi>ingredients</hi> of that ſin againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in it, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt <hi>clear light,</hi> much received <hi>grace,</hi> with full <hi>conſent</hi> of will, having much of <hi>malice</hi> in it; therefore no wonder it became <hi>unpardonable.</hi> And whence is it that the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt, is that ſin unto <hi>death,</hi> hath no more <hi>ſacrifice for it,</hi> but becomes eternally unpardonable, but becauſe it is ever perpetrated and committed in <hi>deſpight of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>conſcience,</hi> againſt his moſt clear and ſtrongeſt convictions, and againſt the moſt perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry checks, and diſſenting reſtraints of the <hi>awakened</hi> and <hi>enlightened</hi> conſcience? Nothing heightens ſin ſo faſt; conſcience may ſay, If I had not come unto you, <hi>you had no ſin:</hi> If I had not done my Office faithfully, you had <hi>ſome cloak for your ſin,</hi> which now you have not. This makes ſins of knowing men, greater then of ignorant: <hi>Englands</hi> ſin grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Jndies, <hi>Judas's perfidiouſneſſe</hi> worſe then <hi>Sauls perſecutions.</hi> The one did it ignorantly, and therefore obtained mercy. The other had no cloak for his ſin; Chriſt gave him warning by the ſop, all took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13</note> he replyed upon conſciences enforcing, <hi>Is it I?</hi> And he therefore died a ſon of <hi>perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe he lived and perſiſted a <hi>ſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: This</hi> is the <hi>ſervant who ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. 12. 47. To him that

                  <hi>knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin, Jam.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>Corollary 4. When a <hi>man lies under the laſh of conſcience, in reſpect of his two laſt offices,</hi> viz. <hi>teſtimoniall,</hi> and <hi>judiciall,</hi> he lies under the <hi>greateſt miſery. Maximus angor conſcientiae</hi>

                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 20. 26.</note> upon him; His puniſhment is greater then he can bear. This is the firſt <hi>woe,</hi> and the hell on earth: for <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18. there is a <hi>hell</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 14. an <hi>hell</hi> before the <hi>lake of fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How fearfull was <hi>Herods</hi> caſe, to be given up to wormes to eat him <hi>alive?</hi> Infinitely more dreadfull to be given up to this <hi>worm</hi> of conſcience to be eaten up <hi>both alive,</hi> and <hi>dead.</hi> How dolefull a ſight is it to ſee a <hi>wolfe,</hi> or a <hi>Cancer,</hi> on the womans tender breaſt, ever gnawing, and ſtinging, never cured! But a worſe <hi>wolf</hi> is the gnawing, and accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. No <hi>fits of convulſion</hi> ſo tearing, and pulling, and racking, as <hi>convulſion fits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> no <hi>ulcer</hi> in the bladder, or bowels ſo painfull as the exulcerated conſcience.</p>
               <p>See this in <hi>Judas,</hi> now brought to a ſight of his ſin, and ſenſe of his miſery, he is like <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the raging ſea that cannot reſt;</hi> Out he cries, I have ſinned, take your money, it hath dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me; from perſon to perſon, from place to place he goes, but his <hi>hell he carries with him;</hi> from the terrour and ſting of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169477:46"/> he cannot run; To death he ſaith, <hi>Fall on me;</hi> to hell, <hi>bury</hi> me, ſo I may be hid from ſight of conſcience; he <hi>ſtrangles</hi> himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not <hi>ſtrangle conſcience;</hi> into <hi>hell</hi> he leapes, not longer able to abide himſelf; and indeed, if there were any place in <hi>hell,</hi> where this <hi>Apollyon</hi> of deſtroying conſcience came not, into it would all the <hi>damned</hi> get to caſe themſelves. <hi>Hell</hi> were not <hi>hell,</hi> if raging conſcience ruled not there; if this worme could ever <hi>die,</hi> that fire might then be <hi>quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Judas</hi> hung himſelf, to eaſe himſelf: but then was <hi>death and hell caſt into the lake of fire, Revel.</hi> 20. 14. He at firſt brake the <hi>neck</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that at laſt brake his <hi>neck;</hi> he had ſtrangled <hi>good</hi> conſcience, an <hi>ill</hi> conſcience ſtrangled him; and being <hi>dead,</hi> all his <hi>bowels</hi> fell out of his body, becauſe all his <hi>conſcience</hi> fell out of his bowels while he was <hi>alive.</hi>

               <p>To conclude this Corollary: The <hi>wrack</hi> of <note place="margin">

Ten particulars I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, and after ſpeake ſomewhat to <note place="margin">Ten good conſciences laid down in ſcripture</note> each of them. Their names are, 1. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Purity.</hi> 3. Of <hi>Sincerity.</hi> 4. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>noffenſive</hi> conſcience. 5. The <hi>well-ſighted</hi> conſcience. 6. The <hi>well-ſpoken</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 7.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt excellent conſcience, is that in the Text, the good conſcience <hi>of faith.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Faith.</note> This onely makes a good conſcience; Nor can all the other <hi>nine</hi> make it ſuch without this. It is impoſſible that any thing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be good, and pleaſe God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Precious faith</hi> makes the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169477:47"/> conſcience of <hi>great price.</hi> It is therefore very obſervable, that in three places of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, The Apoſtle joynes <hi>faith and the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> together, <hi>viz. cap.</hi> 1. v. 5. &amp; v. 19. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 9. Indeed they cannot be parted. The life of faith is ever bound up in the life <hi>and bundle</hi> of good conſcience. There is no good faith, where not good conſcience; nor yet good conſcience, where true faith wanting; where you ſee the one, looke and you ſhall finde the other.

               <p>2. To prevent giving of offence, certaine <hi>Rules</hi> are to be given, as firſt:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider ever what is <hi>expedient,</hi> as well as know what once is <hi>lawfull,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 12. &amp; 10. 23. <hi>All things are lawfull, but all things are not expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle gives a third <hi>Rule</hi> to avoyd offence-giving, 1 Cor. 10. 24. <hi>Let no man ſeek his owne, but every one anothers wealth.</hi> This gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule well obſerved, would make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and our times happy, at once freeing the Church from many calamities, and our ſelves from much guilt in matter of offences.</p>

With whomſoever you have to do, labour to be inoffenſive; That your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> may <hi>pleaſe</hi> whom your <hi>Profeſſion</hi> doth <hi>diſpleaſe.</hi> Call <hi>no man common or uncleane;</hi> loſe no man, harden no man. <hi>Give none offence to the Jew]</hi> There was an old <hi>partition-wall</hi> up between the Jew and the Goſpell; ſome hot ſpirit of our time would have ſaid, Let them go, they are legall, ſuperſtitious, ſtubborne, hereticall, <hi>no hope of them;</hi> why ſhould I regard them?

               <p n="5">5. Study how far <hi>thou art to go</hi> to <hi>pleaſe thy brother,</hi> which is a great duty. The Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. prayes for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> That <hi>they might walke worthy of the Lord, in all pleaſing,</hi> as if no carriage were worthy of the Goſpel, but of the <hi>plancid</hi> and yeelding Spirit.

There are five tender Conſciences thus, <note place="margin">A faultie tenderneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and never an one of them good.</p>
               <p>1. When one is ſo tender, that he cannot endure to be touched with a <hi>reproofe.</hi> This is a tenderneſs indeed, but an <hi>unſound</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſed tenderneſs; not ſo tender but that hee dare adventure <hi>on a ſinne,</hi> but he muſt not be told of his ſinne; The man who hath a byle, when you touch him, ſaith, gently I pray, it is tender, when indeed it is <hi>ſore,</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifi'd, and harbors much filth within it. This is an ill tenderneſs. Thus onely wicked ones are tender, and ſqueamiſh, <hi>prophecy to us ſmooth things,</hi> ſay they, Iſa. 30. 10. Give us of your ſofteſt Pillows, <hi>Ez.</hi> 13. 18. Oh how tender was <hi>Amaziah,</hi> the prieſt of <hi>Bethel,</hi> Amos 7. 10. He complaines of <hi>Amos,</hi> as a turbulent, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169477:83"/> factious Preacher, The Land <hi>is not able to bear al his words,</hi> he muſt be reſtrained. How tender were <hi>Jeremies</hi> accuſers, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 4. <hi>We beſeech thee let this man be put to death, for be weakeneth the hands of the people, and he ſeeketh not the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this people, but the hurt.</hi> Hee is no waies well affected to the State, but a malignant; So they, Act. 5. 33. &amp; 7. 54. were <hi>cut to the heart</hi> and <hi>gnaſhed at</hi> Steven <hi>with their teeth,</hi> as if they could have eaten him up. Thus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was the High Prieſt, who <hi>rent his clothes</hi> at <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 65</note> Chriſts ſuppoſed blaſphemy, when he ſhould have <hi>rent his heart</hi> for his owne treaſon, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and hypocriſy. All this is not tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but effeminate ſoftneſs outwardly, and inwardly the greateſt hardneſs. There may be <hi>mollities animi,</hi> where is <hi>maxima durities cordis,</hi> as in the godly there may be <hi>ſumma durities or is, &amp; vultus,</hi> when <hi>maxima mollitudo cordis,</hi> Ezek. 3. 9. Chriſts face <hi>was harder then flint,</hi> Iſa. 50. 7. Ezekiels then <hi>Adamant,</hi> when the heart was moſt <hi>tender.</hi> So <hi>è contra,</hi> wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men have tender <hi>skin,</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> hard <hi>heart</hi> and ſpirit. Their Paſſions are <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>touchy;</hi> Their diſpoſitions <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>unruly;</hi> Their love to their <hi>ſinne</hi> is tender, to their <hi>ſoules</hi> as <hi>cruell as the Oſtriches of the wilderneſs,</hi> Lam. 4. 3. This is a corrupt ſoftneſs, like that in a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Plum,</hi> which if you touch, you breake; But it hath a hard ſtone in the midſt that will not breake. So have theſe a hard <hi>ſtone</hi> in the heart, when ſo much outward tenderneſſe. But the right tenderneſs is that which was,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169477:84"/> Act. 2. 37. <hi>Their hearts were peirced, and being pricked in heart, they cryed out, Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> They fall not out with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but with themſelves. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> looked upon it as a marke of grace in <hi>Alipius,</hi> when he had reproved his ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> Stage playes, <hi>Quod ilius acciperet ad ſuccenſendum mihi, acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit honeſtus Adoleſcens ad ſuccenſendum ſibi, &amp; ad me ardentius diligendum.</hi> When another would have been angrie with me, the honeſt youth (ſaith he) was onely angrie with himſelf, and loved me the better. Right tenderneſs is to be very ſenſible of the evil of ſin, and the danger thereof; thereupon impatient of the ſin, but eaſily patient of any Reproof; <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me,</hi> Pſal. 141. 5. that my heart may not <hi>ſtab me</hi> another day; and let him <hi>reprove,</hi> that my own heart may not <hi>reproach me:</hi> you ſee the ſound hand will endure touching and ſhaking, when the ſore hand muſt not bee ſo much as touched.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Scrupulouſneſs;</hi> As when one hath got ſome ſtone or gravell in his ſhooe, he cannot ſet his foot on the ground without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; he cries out <hi>Tender,</hi> when his foot is plainly <hi>Galled;</hi> This is no good tenderneſs neither: Take out this Gravel, and hee may walk without any more ado. The Apoſtles rule will help him. Rom. 14. 5. <hi>Let every man bee fully perſuaded in his own minde.</hi> His meaning is not that he would have us at adventures lay aſide all <hi>Enquiries;</hi> but onely rid our ſelves of unneceſſarie, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

                  <hi>ſcruples.</hi> Unneceſſarie ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is when a man makes a ſtir about that in which God's Word is <hi>ſilent,</hi> and makes a <hi>ſin</hi> where the Scripture makes <hi>none.</hi> The prieſts made one while a great ſcruple of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> the houſe of a heathen <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 28.</note> man, leaſt they ſhould bee ceremonially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and ſo held from the Paſſeover, but made no matter of defiling themſelves <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> with the guilt of Innocent bloud.

This is a ſad Tenderneſs, or <hi>Soreneſs,</hi> or <hi>Bruiſedneſs,</hi> or woundedneſs of Spirit, through too much ſenſibleneſs of ſin tending apace towards fearfull diſtruſt of God, and deſpair of mercy. This poor ſoul is as a man who <hi>hath all his bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and all his members diſlocated,</hi> and out of Order, his <hi>heart melting like wax in his belly,</hi>

               <p>Or as you ſee another man who hath a ſore <hi>raw eye,</hi> or an eye that hath been ſcalded, or ſcorched in the fire, it is very tender, it cannot look upon the Sun, or a Candle without offence; it alwaies runs, drops, trickles, and requires ſome ſoft ſilk, or fine Linnen to bee before it.

               <p>God's Servants have alwaies thought they could no wayes do better ſervice then in ſeeking to ſtop <hi>new errors</hi> in their Courſe, or to procure Libertie and encouragement to <hi>old Truths,</hi> therefore have been content to loſe Places, Offices, Life, that Truth might not loſe ground, and would adventure any thing to help forward Truth. There is a notable ſtorie of One <hi>Terentius</hi> a valiant and Fortunate General under the Arrian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alens,</hi> who for the many great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had done, was bidden by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to ask whatſoever he would for his Reward, and he ſhould have it. But it is ſaid, he made no uſe of this large Offer, to ask Gold, Silver, Lands, or Offices, but made this onely Requeſt to the Emperour, That one Publick Church might be granted to the Orthodox and ſound Chriſtians, who were denied the Publick Exerciſe of their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169477:91"/> Religion. The Emperour in a rage tore his Petition in pieces, and bad him ask ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe; but he gathered up the torn pieces of his Petition, and made the ſame requeſt again, and ſaid, Oh Emperour, you promiſed to grant me any Requeſt that I ſhould ask, I have nothing elſe to ask but <note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, Tenderneſs of ſpirit will ſhew it ſelf as in regard of God's <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, this gracious Conſcience doth <note place="margin">4. Of Gods Threats.</note> ever <hi>yeeld, and melt, and break</hi> under any
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169477:91"/> Threat of God's Word, or ſenſe of Gods Diſpleaſure; Thus you read that <hi>Joſiah</hi> was affected upon the reading the Threats of the Law, his heart was tender, <hi>he rent his clothes, he mourned and wept,</hi> 2 King. 22. 19. But when the like Roll of Judgment was read in the ears of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> it is charged on them as a ſigne of their graceleſs obſtinacie and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that not a man of them was <hi>afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the King, nor any of</hi>

                  <hi>Shall the trumpet ſound, and the people tremble?</hi> and ſhall the Lord God ſpeak, and <hi>we not be afraid?</hi> This gracious ſoul is like the waterie and dropping cloud, which hangs low, and is full of the Influence of Heaven, and leaves a bleſſing where it falls: whereas your high-flown, ſecure perſons, and ſuch as in their own account need <hi>no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but are paſt it, or like thoſe higher and brighter clouds, which have nothing in them.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, this gracious frame of heart doth make the ſoul <hi>kindely thaw and melt</hi> under <note place="margin">6.

This is right Evangelical Tenderneſs; Shall not ſo much Love conſtrain me? What cords ſhall draw me, if theſe draw not? <hi>After ſuch deliverance as this, ſhall we again break thy commands? Wouldſt thou not then be more angrie with us?</hi> ſay thoſe godly and Goſpel ſpirits in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 14. This was the gracious Temper of that poor woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into Tears by the warm over-coming Love of Chriſt. Chriſt <hi>loved much,</hi> ſhee <hi>mourned much;</hi> Chriſt <hi>forgave much,</hi> ſhee <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented much.</hi> This is the right Goſpel Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>fear the Lord and his goodneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 3. 5. Have you not ſeen the hardeſt <hi>Sugar</hi> diſſolve of it ſelf when dipt into the Cup of wine? Nothing ſo powerfully breaks and diſſolves a gracious heart, or hath the like molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying virtue, as to bee ſteeped in the Love of Chriſt. Lord <hi>thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thy Eyes.</hi> The Maſters eye and heart of Love ſet <hi>Peters</hi> heart afire, and his eyes a broach.

                     <hi>I</hi> Rom. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>love</hi> the leſs, becauſe God hath <hi>loved me</hi> more? Is this <hi>to requite the Lord,</hi> to be <hi>moſt ſtraitened</hi> when his bowels have <hi>been moſt enlarged?</hi> Muſt not Judgements needs break, whom Mercies cannot bend? Is he not worthy to have <hi>Judgement without mercie,</hi> that <hi>deſpiſeth mercie?</hi> And may not he exſpect to finde grace turned into furie, who hath alreadie turned <hi>Grace into wantonneſs?</hi> This laſt is the Tenderneſs of <hi>filial Love,</hi> as the former was of <hi>filial fear.</hi> And ſo much of this firſt part of Tenderneſs in reſpect of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Tenderneſs of Conſcience muſt <note place="margin">2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others.</note> ſhew it ſelf in reference <hi>to Men</hi> as well as to God, and ſo both to all in generall; and to each man particularly, to <hi>godly,</hi> to <hi>wicked,</hi> to <hi>ſtrong,</hi> to <hi>weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>To the godly,</hi> and that, 1. <hi>Forbearing</hi> to <note place="margin">1. The Godly. 1.

He is ever tender of the Peace, and ſtudious of the ſatisfaction of every honeſt man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If my meat, or my wine, or my apparell, or my hair, or my Companie make <hi>my brother to offend,</hi> I will eat no meat, drink no wine, put on no ſuch apparel, keep on no ſuch hair, frequent no ſuch companie while the world ſtandeth, leaſt <hi>I make my brother to offend.</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:169477:93"/> This is the voice of Tender or True Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, like that of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>2. We muſt bee as tender of their <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging, or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting them.</note> that we expoſe not them, or rather Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them to reproch. What an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inſtance have we in <hi>Joſeph?</hi> who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a juſt man for his labour. He had looked upon <hi>Mary</hi> formerly as a godly and gracious woman, and ſhe being now with childe, he knew not what to think on it; but having a purpoſe to leave her (being formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to her) that he might not bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon himſelf, he purpoſed to leave her privately, that the world might not take notice of any ſuch thing, that ſo he might not bring reproach upon her. <hi>Joſeph her</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>husband</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>being a juſt man, and not willing to make her a publike example, was minded to put her away privately.</hi> This was his Care, his Honeſtie, his Tenderneſs, and his Righteouſneſs. But where ſhall wee finde the like Tenderneſs or Righteouſneſs now adayes to <hi>ſalve</hi> the <hi>Credit,</hi> and <hi>conceal</hi> the <hi>failings</hi> of our brethren? we are glad if we have any thing to <hi>Paradeigmatize</hi> them for, and ſay, <hi>Report, and we will report it,</hi> Jer. 20. 10. As if we were of the minde of him of whom <hi>Jerom</hi> ſpake, whom he calls paſſionately <hi>Scriptorem illiteratum, qui Procacitatem, &amp;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ruffinus.</note> 
                  <hi>maledicentium in omnes ſignum eſtimet bonae Conſcientiae,</hi> that is, to think there is no other token of a good Conſcience then to ſpeak ill of other men, and traduce their perſons,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169477:93"/> and laie open their nakedneſs to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. That godly Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was quite of another minde, who was wont to ſaie if he ſhould finde a Chriſtian Biſhop, or <hi>Paſtor overtaken in any infamous Act, he would rather pull off his purple Robe to throw upon him to cover him, then that any ſhould come by his means to hear of it, to the ſcandal of Religion.</hi> I am ſure this is more like to the Example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who caſts his <hi>Purple Robe</hi> upon us, that our ſins ſhould not be taken notice of.</p>
               <p>3. This good Conſcience will make us tender of <hi>diſagreeing</hi> with, or <hi>dividing from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, or dividing from them.</note> any who are godly, upon unneceſſarie and frivolous grounds. Enter not upon doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputations, fall not upon queſtions that nouriſh jangling, but deſtroy <hi>Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> This is the common ſin, or miſerie ſhall I ſay, of theſe times? Or ſhall I ſay both? There is much of <hi>miſery</hi> in this <hi>ſin,</hi> and much of <hi>ſin</hi> in this <hi>miſery.</hi> How much <hi>good is ill</hi> ſpoken of ordinarily, becauſe it is the good of ſuch perſons againſt whom we have taken up a prejudice? and how much ill is gladly ſpoken of <hi>with the Joy of all the heart,</hi> when it is of ſome perſons, of whom we had rather hear ill then well? when we ſhould ſtudie to make and repreſent one another as good as we could, that we might <hi>congregate</hi> and <hi>unite,</hi> we ſtrive to make (at leaſt to <hi>repreſent)</hi> one another as bad as we can, that we may <hi>diſgregate,</hi> and <hi>divide.</hi> This is a lamentation, and cannot but be for a lamentation to all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169477:94"/> godly, and peaceable ſpirits, to ſee ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde Heats and <hi>Animoſities</hi> raiſed and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed among men (otherwiſe) godly, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and learned, differing about matters of no great moment; yet filling the world with bitter invectives one againſt the other. <hi>Jerom</hi> is fallen out with <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and writes bitterly againſt him, <hi>Ruffinus</hi> thinks as much ſcorn of <hi>Jerom,</hi> as he could poſſibly of him, he reſolves not to <hi>die</hi> in his <hi>debt,</hi> he writes as bitterly againſt him. The truth is though both good men, they were both to blame. There was too much of paſſion in them both. Muſt they needs be condemned, and abandoned by all men, whom ſome learned men have once condemned, and that haply out of inconſiderate prejudice? muſt a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man be preſently expunged out of the <hi>Calendar</hi> of Saints, and enrolled in the black Bill of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> becauſe it pleaſeth ſome to reckon him ſuch? Muſt <hi>Jerom's</hi> onely Cenſure, and ſharper writings againſt <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidius, Jovinian, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igilantius, Aerius,</hi> or ſome others, make them <hi>ipſo facto</hi> execrable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? When upon through diſquiſition and calmer conſideration their reputed errors were but the prejudices of thoſe preſent times: Oh how were it to bee wiſhed that this were more thought of upon all hands: So that Chriſtians might not be to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were to the <hi>Samaritans.</hi> Joh. 4. 9. <hi>The Jewes have no dealing with Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans.</hi> And that one godly man might not
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169477:94"/> be to other godly men <hi>as a Shepherd to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,</hi> Gen. 46. 34. and that our publique meetings, and our religions exerciſes there, might not be as the Iſraelites Sacrifice in the ſight of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> both of them <hi>an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> Ex. 8. 26. How happy were we if we had ſo learned <hi>Christ,</hi> as to put off with the old man, according to the Apoſtles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, Eph 4. 31, 32. <hi>All bitterneſſe, and wrath, and clamour, and evill ſpeaking, with all malice, and to be kinde one to another, tender-hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As we muſt be thus tender to all godly <note place="margin">2 Weaker ones.</note> ones in <hi>generall,</hi> ſo eſpecially to the <hi>weaker ones</hi> among them, no ways to <hi>diſcourage</hi> them, deſpiſe them, or impoſe any <hi>burdens</hi> upon, much leſſe lay any <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> before them; but to <hi>beare their infirmities,</hi> Ro. 15. 1. <hi>condeſcend</hi> to their terms, Rom. 12. 16. <hi>And not to pleaſe our ſelves, but them rather.</hi> This is to be <hi>like-minded to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all his little ones that believe in him: He himſelf <hi>beares their infirmities, and feeles their ſickneſſes,</hi> Mat. 8. 17. <hi>He</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>gathereth up the Lambs with his arm, and carrieth them in his boſome, and gently leadeth them that are with young,</hi> Eſay 40. 11. <hi>He doth not ſtrive nor cry, nor is his voyce heard in the ſtreets: The bruiſed Reed he breaketh not, and the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, this Conſcience you may ever know it by this, that it makes one flie and avoid the <hi>common ſins,</hi> and <hi>prevailing errours of the times.

But chap. 13. 15. to ver. 23. much more: when ſome were <hi>treading wine-preſſes, bringing in ſheaves, lading aſſes,</hi> and <hi>brought in burdens into Jeruſalem on the Sabbath,</hi> as if it had been like any other day; <hi>He teſtified againſt the parties offending,</hi> declares his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſcience againſt their practice. And to the <hi>Nobles and Magiſtrates</hi> he goes expoſtulating with them for winking at ſuch abuſes. <hi>What evil is this ye do, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabbath-day? Did not our fathers thus? and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this Citie? yet ye bring more wrath upon Iſrael by prophaning the Sabbath.</hi> And at laſt he puts forth his <hi>coercive power,</hi> to prevent the like. A gracious heart, if he ſee the <hi>morallitie</hi> of the Sabbath queſtioned, as now it is by ſome, he riſeth up for the ſtrict Obſervation of it the more zealouſly. So again, when he ſaw the <hi>Prieſts mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> embezeled, the Levites and Prieſts (the then Miniſters) under diſeſteem and povertie, the Prieſts Patrimonie devoured by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious encroachers, their appropriated Tithes and ſet maintenance detained by dunghill-minded Profeſſours, whoſe <hi>Gain is all their Godlineſs,</hi> and who would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain (it may be) there was nothing due to them <hi>Jure divino;</hi> They muſt labour with their hands as well as others.

He doth not go to the common people, whoſe hand and heart was in it, they would all have cried out, <hi>No more tithes, no more Prieſts;</hi> Eaſe us of this charge; The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things we <hi>ſow</hi> upon our Prieſts are above all the ſpiritual fruits <hi>we reap,</hi> or ever look to reap by them. Cannot Religion be upheld without <hi>theſe Prieſts?</hi> cannot theſe Prieſts afford their ſervice to God and his Church <hi>gratis,</hi> and of <hi>free-coſt?</hi> or, at leaſt, be content to live upon the voluntarie <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions</hi> of the Church? He doth not go to theſe, I ſay, Reaſon is not to be exſpected among the multitude; but he goes to the <hi>Nobles, and chief Repreſentatives;</hi> he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and expoſtulated with them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 11. Why is the Houſe of God forſaken? Shall our return out of <hi>Babylon</hi> be <hi>honoured,</hi> and our Reformation bear date and be made <hi>famous</hi> for our laying aſide <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Publike Church-worſhip, Church-men,</hi> and <hi>Church-maintenance?</hi> Then I contended with the Nobles, ſaith he, Why is the Houſe of God forſaken? <hi>What a reproach</hi> will this be to our Reformation? The Nobles it ſeems were either <hi>too forward,</hi> as well as others, to keep back and take away Church mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or put the people upon ſuch deſigns,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:169477:100"/> or elſe the Nobles were <hi>too backward</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the people to pay their duties. They made not ſuch proviſion for the Miniſters livelihood and ſubſiſtence as they ſhould, but now <hi>Nehemiah</hi> takes care to ſee it amended, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. 13. So his deteſtation of their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> and Extortions, and the <note place="margin">Nehem. 5. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> means he uſed for Reformation and Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, you may read in the fift Chapter. By this you ſee a godly man obſerves what are the prevailing ſins of the times, and he ſets himſelf againſt them; when another now of no Conſcience thinks it a principall point of Prudence to give way to that which is like to take and obtain the upper hand, yea, to ſit ſtill, connive, keep ſilence, and it may be againſt his Conſcience and Judgement to comply as <hi>Peter</hi> once did, while he was in the high Prieſts Palace, he ſaw all ſpake againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it was <hi>to no purpoſe</hi> for him to ſpeak for him; nor was <hi>it ſafe.</hi> But it coſt him dear. Yea, ſome account it a Note of ſingular Pietie to be forward in promoting ſuch a way and opinion as it at preſent the prevailing way, and riſing opinion, though they ſee no weight of Reaſon leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the ſuffering Conſcience.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe laſt conſcience we ſpoke of, was the <note place="margin">Of the Paſſive and ſuffering Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> 
                  <hi>Tender Conſcience,</hi> here we are to ſpeak of another Conſcience as good as that, but quite of a different nature, that is, the <hi>Paſſive</hi> and <hi>hardy Conſcience,</hi> which is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no fear, timorouſneſs, or tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all in it, <hi>as to ſuffering;</hi> as the former was not to allow of any patience, or bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at all, <hi>as to ſinning.</hi> Yet are they not ſo oppoſite neither as they may ſeem to be, but both are to be found in the ſame perſons; gracious diſpoſitions alway agreeing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one helping and increaſing another: The more of that <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> we ſpoke of in the laſt Chapter, the more of this <hi>Paſsiveneſs</hi> if need be will be found, of which we ſpeak here; yea, this <hi>hardineſs</hi> proceeds from that <hi>tenderneſs,</hi> and is <hi>inſeparable</hi> from it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fitly handled next to it. For as there is a bad, baſe, and <hi>ſinfull</hi> tenderneſs, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from as ſinfull a <hi>hardneſs,</hi> or <hi>hardneſs,</hi> ſo is there a <hi>holy</hi> and honourable <hi>hardneſs,</hi> that proceeds from the <hi>beſt tenderneſs.</hi> There is a childiſh ſoftneſs, and effeminate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>face</hi> and <hi>fleſh,</hi> which comes from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>heart;</hi> and there is again, a gallant and reſolute <hi>hardneſs of face</hi> and <hi>back,</hi> as unto
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169477:108"/> men, to indure all kinds of pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which comes from reall tenderneſs of heart and conſcience before God.</p>
               <p>Good Conſcience then muſt not be bred ſo daintily, and kept ſo tenderly, but that it may digeſt the worlds hardeſt uſage, and courſeſt fare; it muſt be <hi>Patiens famis &amp; fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goris, enſis &amp; ignis,</hi> Patient to all <hi>ſufferings,</hi> impatient onely of <hi>ſin.</hi> This puts within a man a heart of <hi>adamant,</hi> and upon a man a face of <hi>braſs</hi> or flint: He is not daſhed out of countenance with the fiery countenance of inraged Tyrants, nor made to tremble at the ſight of a <hi>ſeven-times-heated</hi> fiery furnace. <hi>We are not carefull to anſwer thee, O King, in this matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that Conſcience which St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſo highly commendeth, 1 Peter 2. 19. <hi>This is thank-worthy,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>if a man for conſcience toward God indure grief, ſuffering wrongfully.</hi> You have not ſuch an expreſſion in all the <hi>Bible</hi> again, that any thing ſhould be <hi>thank-worthy</hi> with God; for our Saviour ſaith, Luke 17. 9, 10. <hi>Doth any Maſter thank his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, when he doth what he commands, I trow not?</hi> So nor can we expect thanks, but <hi>when we have done all, we are,</hi> to ſay, <hi>unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have but done out duty.</hi> But here St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ver. 19. ſaith, <hi>This is thank-worthy, &amp;c.</hi> and repeateth it again, ver. 20. <hi>If ye do well, and ſuffer patiently, this is acceptable or thank-worthy with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a mighty honour put upon this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169477:108"/> Conſcience, we muſt therefore get it. Know that all is nothing if this be wanting, Not thy Conſcience of <hi>faith, puritie</hi> and <hi>ſinceritie,</hi> not thy <hi>Quick-ſighted, well-ſpoken, well-doing,</hi> not thy <hi>Inoffenſive</hi> or <hi>Tender Conſcience,</hi> if thou have not alſo this Propertie, All is not worth a <hi>Thank.</hi> As all thou canſt do is not worth a <hi>Thank,</hi> if not for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake; ſo it ſeems Conſcience it ſelf is not worth a Thank if not for <hi>ſuffering ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This did commend the Chriſtians in old times, they had learned to <hi>ſuffer</hi> as much for Religion, as we to <hi>diſpute</hi> for it, or rather <hi>againſt</hi> it. They could be content to be <hi>bound,</hi> that Truth might be at <hi>libertie;</hi> and to die, that Religion might not die; and they choſe rather to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for the Goſpel, then that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould ſuffer through them; They were more willing that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould <hi>live upon</hi> them, and their <hi>ruines,</hi> then we are to live upon <hi>Religion,</hi> and its <hi>ruine</hi> now adaies. Any thing was eaſie for them to ſuffer for Conſcience, onely one thing they could not endure, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>ſuffer in,</hi> and <hi>from Conſcience.</hi> And here might I write a whole Volume of the ſufferings of <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and later times, or <hi>tranſcribe</hi> many large Volumes of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, treating of this ſubject in their <hi>Martyrologies.</hi> They were <hi>deprived</hi> of States, <hi>degraded</hi> of Offices, yet did <hi>bear</hi> it; they were impriſoned; they were exiled, yet did <hi>endure</hi> it; they were ſlain, racked, tortured, yet did they <hi>ſuffer</hi> it.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169477:109"/> Some were <hi>hanged,</hi> ſome <hi>headed,</hi> ſome were <hi>burned,</hi> ſome <hi>drowned,</hi> ſome <hi>devoured</hi> of wilde beaſts, ſome <hi>pull'd in pieces</hi> by men more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage then beaſts, yet they did all <hi>bear</hi> it, and rejoyced they ſuffered for <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>for God.

To be eaten up with <hi>flies,</hi> and ſtung with <hi>waſps</hi> he did account farre more deſirable, that he might preſerve his <note place="margin">

There were many Chriſtians together ſtopt up in <hi>Lakes,</hi> or <hi>Caves artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> made cloſe, which Lakes, or Ditches were filled with a companie of <hi>Dormiſe,</hi> kept hungrie to gnaw and feed upon the poor Chriſtians, they all the while bound hand

               <p> But how little of this good Conſcience is to be found now adaies, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Who is on my ſide? who?</hi> Our times have brought forth many a degenerate Chriſtian, <hi>ſilken</hi> and <hi>ſatten</hi> Chriſtians, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for the <hi>right hand and the left,</hi> if Chriſt have any Kingdoms, Mannours, or Honours to beſtow: But if a Croſs, they all forſake him, and fly, and ſhift for themſelves, as the terrified Diſciples did the night of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>Luther</hi> call's ſome of the Divines of his Time <hi>Theologos Gloriae,</hi> they would not ſuffer.

               <p>There is no condition, or ſort of men, have in Scripture more abundant, and more excellent <hi>Promiſes</hi> then theſe that ſuffer; And none in Scripture have more <hi>Cautions,</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> given, then thoſe ſet down to <hi>regulate</hi> and <hi>circumſcribe</hi> our ſufferings: for all that ſuffer cannot ſay they ſuffer for Conſcience, and for <hi>God:</hi> and then what thank can they exſpect from <hi>God,</hi> if they ſuffer for their own default, they muſt (as we ſay) <hi>thank themſelves.</hi>

                  <hi>which is good, before men moleſt us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13. The good Conſcience muſt not go out of <hi>God's way</hi> to meet with ſufiering, as he muſt not go out of <hi>ſuffering way</hi> to meet with <hi>ſin.</hi> In a word, the Chriſtian can never expect to take the degree of <hi>Martyr,</hi> till he have firſt commenced <hi>Saint.</hi> It is not <hi>Poena,</hi> but <hi>Cauſa</hi> that commends the ſufferer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he do ſuffer for <hi>il-doing,</hi> yet he muſt be ſure to look to it, that it be <hi>wrongfully,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 19.

And then we are under the ſame Promiſe of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if we ſuffered for <hi>Righteouſneſs; But if ye do well, and ſuffer wrongfully, taking it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, this is that which is thank-worthy with God.

               <p>Religious <hi>Obadiah</hi> left it to <hi>Elias</hi> to judge of his ſincerity, and whether he truly <hi>feared God</hi> or no, 1 Kin. 18. 13. <hi>Was it not told my Lord what</hi> I <hi>did when</hi> Jezabel <hi>ſlew the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Lord, how I hid an hundred men of the Lords Prophets, and ſed them by fifty in a cave with bread and water?</hi>

Yea, <hi>Every liberall ſoul deviſeth liberall things, and by liberall things ſhall he ſtand,</hi> Iſai. 32. 8. <hi>When the Inſtruments of the Churle are evil, he deviſeth wicked devices againſt the poor, to make empty the ſoul of the hungry, and to cauſe the drink of the thirſty to fail,</hi> Iſa. 32. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Conſcience knows it is bound in duty, as much to ſhew <hi>charitie</hi> to neighbour, as <hi>love</hi> to God; and to the poor neighbour this love of <hi>beneficence</hi> and compaſſion, as to God the love of <hi>obedience</hi> and complacency.</p>
               <p>This is indeed <hi>cum aliis ſcire,</hi> to know and feel the heart of a ſtranger and widow, and <note place="margin">Exo. 23. 9.</note> to ſay with <hi>Adrian,</hi> What I would have the rich be to me were I poor, that muſt I do to him my ſelf being rich.</p>
               <p>Yea this is <hi>cum Deo ſcire,</hi> who conſiders the poor and needy, relieveth the ſtranger,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169477:116"/> 
                  <hi>He doth execute,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 10. 18, 19. <hi>the judgement of the fatherleſs and widow, and loveth the ſtranger in giving him food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Love ye therefore the ſtranger, for ye were ſtrangers in the Land of Egyp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas the ill conſciences of theſe times! <hi>What meaneth the bleating of the ſheep, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the exen, ſhall I ſay?</hi> Or, <hi>What meaneth the beating of the poor to pieces, and grinding of their very faces,</hi> ſaith the Lord? Surely he will enter into judgement with the Antients of the People, and with the Princes thereof, becauſe <hi>the ſpoil of the poor is in their houſes,</hi> Iſa. 3. 14, 15. What judgments do you read threatened in all the Prophets, for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull neglecting or oppreſſing of the poor, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 6. God threatens <hi>Iſrael</hi> not to <hi>turn away their puniſhment, becauſe they made no more of the poor man and his cauſe, then of a pair of old ſhooes.</hi> The like <hi>Micah</hi> 3. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Surely this is one of the <hi>crying</hi> ſins of our times, that the cauſe <hi>is not</hi> judged, the cauſe <hi>of the poor,</hi> and the <hi>right of the needie.</hi> But <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 28, 29.</note> may we not ſay, <hi>Hath not the Lord begun to viſit for theſe things, and ſhall be not be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this</hi> ere he hath done? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 15. When the Apoſtle in a certain caſe would tell a man he walks not <hi>conſcientiouſly,</hi> he tels him, Thou walkeſt not <hi>charitably:</hi> What is it therefore to walk charitably, but undeniably to walk conſcientiouſly?

               <p>The Phariſees of old had ſaid, <hi>Thou muſt love thy neighbour,</hi> but corrupted the Text with another addition, <hi>Thou maieſt hate thy enemie.</hi> Our Saviours command is that thou <hi>Love alſo thy enemie, that thou bleſs them that curſe, that thou pray for them that revile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, yea that we reach out the hand to help thoſe,</hi> who have lift up the heel to hurt us.

               <p>Common <hi>Charitie</hi> may be found among honeſt and ingenuous heathens, yea, there is a Love and agreement among the worſt of men, who have one heart, and one purſe, Prov. 1. 14. and among the <hi>devils themſelves</hi>

               <p>The outward and civil Love we ſpake of is the bleſſing of Families, Beautie of Cities, and the ſtrength of Common-wealths: But this, if it were to be ſeen, is farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and tranſcendent, it is the <hi>Street of gold in the holy Citie,</hi> the rich pavement of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It would be the Crown of the Church <hi>Militant,</hi> for it is the Glorie of the Church <hi>Triumphant;</hi> It would be the <hi>Cement</hi> of the <hi>walls;</hi> It would bee the <hi>Gates</hi> and <hi>Bars</hi> of the Tower of Sion; It would render the <hi>Church fair as the Moon, glorious as the Sun, terrible as an armie with banners.</hi> This Love is the <hi>Mantle,</hi> and <hi>Seamleſs Garment</hi> which Chriſt left to his Church, that it ſhould not be divided, or rent.

               </list>
               <p>This Chapter ſhall ſpeak of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which are in, and the benefits gotten by a good Conſcience: Which appears in five particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>excellency</hi> of good Conſcience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> both in the <hi>Honourable Title</hi> given it above all other graces, and the reall <hi>Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> it hath, if compared with all other things: 1. It hath this proper <hi>Epithite</hi> and denomination given it ordinarily, of <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> Act. 23. 1. 1 Tim. 1. 5. &amp; 19. 1 Pet. 3. 16. &amp; 21. whereas other graces, excellent
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169477:123"/> in their place and kinde, ſeldom called thus. When do you reade of good <hi>faith,</hi> good <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>holineſs,</hi> or <hi>obedience;</hi> but ſtill conſcience is called <hi>good Conſcience.</hi> There is ſurely ſome eminent and ſuperlative goodneſs, yea much <hi>communicative</hi> goodneſs in it. It is <hi>good</hi> it ſelf, and makes the <hi>good faith,</hi> and <hi>good love,</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> &amp;c. which all ceaſe to be <hi>good,</hi> when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Then compare it with all other good things, and it hath the better of them. What <note place="margin">Quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt plena bonis Arca, ſi inanis ſit Conſcien. tia?</note> good is there in a cheſt full of <hi>goods,</hi> when the Conſcience is empty of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> ſaid <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin?</hi> What is a man better if he have all <hi>goods,</hi> and want this one <hi>good?</hi> what if he have good ware in the Shop, good ſtock in the ground, houſhold in the houſe, clothes on his back, and good credit abroad, and have not a good Conſcience in his <hi>heart?</hi> all this were like a rich <hi>ſuit</hi> on an ulcerous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This man is like <hi>Naaman,</hi> a rich man, <note place="margin">2 Kin. 5. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>but a Leper,</hi> a great and honourable man, but <hi>a foule</hi> man. What are all great Parts, and excellent Gifts, and Abilities of minde, without good Conſcience, but as ſo many ſweet <hi>flowers</hi> upon a dead man, wrapt up in fair linen? He is a <hi>dreſt</hi> man, but a <hi>dead</hi> man, outwardly ſweet, inwardly ſmelling; or like a <hi>ſounding braſſe, and tinkling Cymball:</hi> This is above knowledge alone. Adde <hi>Con,</hi> to <hi>Science,</hi> and you have the compleat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>Omnibus numeris perfectum:</hi> Take away
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169477:124"/> 
                  <hi>Con,</hi> and leave all <hi>Science,</hi> you leave nothing but Cyphers. Though, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> many <hi>ſeek Knowledge, and deſire Science, few care for</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is above All <hi>Faith</hi> alone, therefore they oft go together in Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. and 19. and 3. 9. when Conſcience is <hi>put away,</hi> the text ſaith, Faith is <hi>caſt away,</hi> and <hi>ſhipwrackt.</hi> Nothing profits alone without this; not <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 21. not coming to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> Heb. 10. 22. not <hi>Charitie,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. not any <hi>ſerving of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 3. not our <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to men, or Magiſtracie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. not all our <hi>ſufferings,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 19, 20.</p>

                  </note> without Conſcience, you have but the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſe</hi> of a man without the <hi>ſoul.</hi> What is the learned Philoſopher, and eloquent Orator without Conſcience, but a rational brute, or a ſpeaking beaſt? who may like <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs open his mouth to rebuke another more <hi>mad,</hi> yet is <hi>beaten</hi> himſelf.

This <hi>conſtitutes</hi> the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and is that <hi>ſine quâ non.</hi> To ſuppoſe a Chriſtian without <hi>Conſcience</hi> were to ſuppoſe the Sun without <hi>Light,</hi> or fire without <hi>heat;</hi> this is of the very ſame conſequence to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, as the <hi>ſenſe of feeling</hi> is to natural life, which compared with the reſt of the ſenſes hath the preheminence in ſundrie particulars, as the Philoſopher laies down in his <hi>Axiomes,</hi> all applicable to Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tactus Origine primus,</hi> they ſay: <hi>Feeling</hi>

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:169477:125"/> So it is in the Soul, the life of <hi>grace</hi> appears ſooner in the <hi>ſenſibleneſs</hi> of Conſcience, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Compunctions, Heart-ſmitings, and Heart-prickings for ſin and guilt, ſpirituall fears of his danger, ſorrow for his ſin, and miſcrie, then by any other tokens what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tactus</hi> as <hi>Origine primus,</hi> ſo it is <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate maximus, &amp; uſu ſummus,</hi> of greateſt uſe, and abſolute Neceſſitie. It is firſt in the <hi>Original</hi> of life appearing, and the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie above all the other ſenſes in the <hi>continual</hi> courſe of life. A man may want his <hi>ſight,</hi> yet be a <hi>healthful</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> man; he may want his <hi>hearing,</hi> yet bee a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>active,</hi> and <hi>apprehenſive</hi> man; he may want <hi>ſmell</hi> and <hi>taſte,</hi> yet be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> man; but if he want his <hi>feeling,</hi> he is a <hi>dead</hi> man. Theſe ſerve more to the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of natural life, then to the ſimple being; So is Conſcience abſolutely neceſſarie to the very being of a Chriſtian, a man may be <hi>ſhort</hi> in parts, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> in knowledge, <hi>weak</hi> in duties, have <hi>loſt</hi> his comforts, never had the Ornaments of Abilities, Expreſſions, Experiences that ſome others have, yet a very good Chriſtian. But if he have loſt his Conſcience he is a dead Chriſtian altogether.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Tactus,</hi> they ſay, is <hi>Hominis Optimus.</hi> The other ſenſes other creatures excel man in. <hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas other Senſes have a particular <hi>Organ</hi> of their own, and lie confined to a narrow roome; Hearing lies in the <hi>Ear</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Seeing in the <hi>Eie,</hi> Taſte in the <hi>Tongue</hi> or <hi>Palate,</hi> Smell in the <hi>Noſtrils: Feeling</hi> hath no ſuch narrow confinement, but is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the <hi>bodie over,</hi> within and without. So is Conſcience of vaſt and univerſall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent over the whole man, over all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, intentions, words, motions, from firſt to laſt. <hi>Faith</hi> looks to <hi>Promiſes, Fear</hi> to <hi>Threats, Hope</hi> to <hi>futures, Obedience</hi> looks to <hi>duties, Repentance</hi> to <hi>ſins. Conſcience looks to all.</hi> This is the great <hi>Superintendent,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees all, all Graces, duties, all ſins, and ſnares. Therefore ſaith one well, Conſcience
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169477:126"/> is not confined to any one part of the Soul, it is not in the underſtanding alone, not in the memorie, will, affections alone; but it <note place="margin">Dyke.</note> hath place in all the parts of the Soul. Conſcience is the great <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the houſ; ſhe as ſoon as ſhe is up calls up all her maids, ſets them all about their work, and calls <note place="margin">Pro. 31. 15, 27.</note> them to their account.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>virtue and worth</hi> of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is moſt excellent above all other things, becauſe it moſt fortifies the ſoul with ſtrength againſt, and gives victorie over all <hi>Adverſities;</hi> it carries the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wounded through the greateſt afflictions; It's like <hi>Oile</hi> that alwaies ſwims aloft what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>waters</hi> of diſtreſs are below; It is as the <hi>Ark</hi> which hath a window open in the Top to let in the light of Heaven. This like <hi>Elias</hi> Mantle hath divided the waters, and earried godly ſouls through a floud of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries as on drie land. This hath encouraged them in the midſt of fire and faggots, hath accompanied them in <hi>Dens</hi> and <hi>Caves,</hi> and made <hi>Martyrs</hi> ſing in midſt of Priſons and flames; It overcomes all his tormenting Perſecutors; It's like the <hi>Anvile</hi> which breaks all that is beat upon it, but is it ſelf by all ſtrokes made more firm. It makes a man like a brazen wall, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 18. All may fight, none can prevail againſt it; at ſight of fear it ſaith <hi>Aha; At deſtruction and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it doth laugh, and fears not the beaſts of prey,</hi> Job 5. 22.</p>

Bad men may have them, and bad <hi>they finde</hi> them, and as bad or worſe <hi>they leave</hi> them. But this is that which is inconſiſtent with any badneſs, no bad man can have a Good Conſcience. This makes all good it meets with, and leaves them good whom it found evil; It findes ſome <hi>ſinful,</hi> but leaves them <hi>holy;</hi> findes ſome <hi>proud,</hi> leaves them <hi>humble; unmerciful</hi> it findes ſome, leaves them <hi>charitable; covetous</hi> it findes ſome, leaves them <hi>content; unjuſt,</hi> and diſhoneſt it findes

               <p>What <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid long ago of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, <hi>Tum demum fore beatas res publicas, cum aut reges philoſopharentur, aut philoſophi regnarent.</hi> It would never be well in the world, till either Philoſophers were Kings, or Kings Philoſophers; we may certainly ſay, It will then be well with Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, (and not till then) when they that are moſt <hi>conſcientious</hi> are <hi>put in publike place,</hi> and made Magiſtrates, Rulers, Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Officers, Miniſters, &amp;c. or when they that <hi>are</hi> in ſuch place be moſt <hi>conſcientious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good Conſcience is the Treaſurie of good, which therefore brings forth nothing but what is ſo; Good <hi>Communication</hi> to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>hearer,</hi> Good <hi>Converſation</hi> to edifie the <hi>Beholder:</hi> yea, <hi>Conſcientiae ea eſt vis, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith Dr <hi>Ames,</hi> that it alters the nature of things; it makes Actions in their own nature <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> become <hi>good,</hi> and Actions <hi>good</hi> become <hi>better;</hi> as Conſcience when not good makes

                  <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſchief of an evil conſcience</note> 
                  <hi>Conſcience</hi> is not ſo great, but the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>miſchief</hi> of the <hi>evil Conſcience</hi> is as great, which is our ſecond conſideration, and this will appear in <hi>three</hi> particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here commonly is the <hi>firſt decay,</hi> as in the Text you ſee, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> no ſooner had put away their Conſcience, but they ſink their faith, when once <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is <hi>tainted</hi> and become corrupt, then preſently the <hi>Judgement,</hi> then the <hi>Affections,</hi> then the <hi>Life,</hi> and what not? Corruption in the Conſcience is as poiſon in the <hi>ſpring head;</hi> this fountain corrupted all the <hi>ſtreams</hi> run <hi>muddie.</hi> Therefore Satan commonly begins here, and ſeeks Entrance for leſs ſins upon the Conſcience, as Houſe-robbers put in their leſs boies into the windowes, to ſet open all the doors of the houſe for all the companie to enter.
<q>Nemo repente fuit Turpiſſimus—</q>
               </p>
               <p>No man arrives at the height of impietie at once; And this is commonly the firſt ſtep. <hi>One unclean</hi> ſpirit entertained makes room <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 45.</note> for <hi>ſeven worſe</hi> to follow. When Conſcience likes not to <hi>retain the knowledge of God,</hi> God
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169477:130"/> gives up to <hi>vile affections,</hi> at length to a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde,</hi> at laſt to be filled with all <hi>manner of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1. 26, 28, 29. The hopefull <hi>Profeſſour</hi> by this meanes ſoon becomes a dangerous <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> and at laſt a down-right <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in life, as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15, 16. when once the minde and Conſcience is defiled, <hi>they may profeſs ſtill to know, but in works they denie God, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, diſobedient, and to every good work as any reprobate.</hi> When the <hi>wormwood ſtar</hi> falls into the fountain of Conſcience, all the rivers become bitter; the ſun beginning to ſet in Conſcience, night haſtens on in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Then <hi>farewell Grace.</hi> And when the ſun goes back in the heaven of Conſcience, the ſhadow muſt needs go back as many degrees in the Diall of Comfort, Then <hi>farewell Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As the firſt decay is here commonly begun, ſo it <hi>proves the worſt decay and danger</hi> that can befall a man, a breach in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is like a breach in the Sea banks, proves <hi>deſperate;</hi> or like the Leake ſprung in the ſhip, drowns men in utter perdition; after a crack in Conſcience a man proves an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bankrupt; after other ſhipwracks one may recover and get up again, there are <hi>poſt naufragium Tabul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> but this is a fatall and commonly irrecoverable ſhipwrack.</p>
               <p>Some ſins and ſlips are like breaking of a <hi>Leg,</hi> or an <hi>Arm,</hi> which may be ſet again; this is like breaking the <hi>Neck,</hi> few recover, to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169477:130"/> take hold of the paths of life after this. <hi>Judas</hi> brake his Conſcience Neck, and that brake his Neck.</p>
               <p>Enquire as oft as you will, by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees any is come up to the higheſt ſins. As for inſtance, how ſome came to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over to laſciviouſneſs, to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all <hi>uncleanneſs even with greedineſs.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 19. The Apoſtle tells us they had been practiſing upon their Conſcience firſt, they had firſt blinded their mindes, and had <hi>ſtunted</hi> their Conſcience to bring them to that <hi>dedolencie,</hi> that they might bee paſt feeling.</p>
               <p>Again, do you wonder and enquire, how it is that in theſe laſt daies ſo many do <hi>depart from the faith, and give heed to ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> yea, to the very <hi>doctrines of devils,</hi> as was foretold? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. the anſwer is at hand in the next verſe, <hi>They had firſt ſeared and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you enquire again, how it comes that ſome moſt hopefull Profeſſours become at laſt moſt violent and enraged Perſecutors, and as bold broachers of accurſed errours? you have the anſwer in the Text, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> laid down their <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi> weapons Faith and a good Conſcience, then became filled with <hi>new wine,</hi> then grew <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> themſelves, then <hi>vented</hi> blaſphemies, then <hi>were delivered</hi> up to Satan, as fitter for Hell then the Church. They fell into prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions and conceits, making a fable
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169477:131"/> of the Reſurrection, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 17. At laſt this <hi>Alexander</hi> came to be an open enemie to <hi>Paul,</hi> and Perſecutor of his doctrine, whom he praieth againſt more then he doth againſt any other, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. This is indeed the readie way, nay the onely way to ſin that unpardonable ſin, the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, which never hath <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> becauſe it never hath <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man that hath loſt his Conſcience is like a <hi>Bee</hi> that hath loſt his ſting, becomes a <hi>Droan</hi> ever after, and is at laſt expelled the <hi>Hive.</hi> The beginning of the Decaie of Conſcience is like the beginning of the <hi>Hectick</hi> feaver, which at firſt, as the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſaith, were eaſily cured, but that it is hardly known; but at laſt it is eaſily known, but hardly cured.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third danger and miſchief is, that either thou muſt reſolve to make this <hi>Good warfare,</hi> required in the Text, for a <hi>Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> or to ſuffer an <hi>ill warfare</hi> made upon thee from an <hi>ill Conſcience;</hi> either thou muſt make this <hi>Tree good, and his fruit good, or elſe make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt:</hi> but <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33.</note> know that this war is the <hi>worſt war</hi> which can bee made. All wars are bad, and end in bitterneſs, but of all wars <hi>civil wars</hi> are the moſt dreadfull, worſe when it is between Citie and Citie, then if it were Nation with Nation; and of all civil wars <hi>domeſtical</hi> in the ſame Familie when divided is worſe, then when a Kingdom divided; And in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169477:131"/> ſame familie again, <hi>Matrimonial war</hi> when in the ſame bed is worſe, then any other war in the ſame houſe between father and ſon: for where the <hi>Relation</hi> is neareſt, <hi>diviſion</hi> there is unkindeſt. But there is one war yet worſe then all theſe, the <hi>perſonal diviſion</hi> is worſe then any diviſion between man and wife. This is to ſpeak properly the onely <hi>Inteſtine</hi> war, when <hi>two are divided againſt three, and three againſt two. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> joyning together to keep in order <hi>Will, Affections,</hi> and <hi>Practiſes;</hi> but theſe joyntly riſe up to ſuppreſs their Legall and Rightfull Superiours <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a ſad Storie to read that of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his two ſons, who ſeparating from our Churches in <hi>England,</hi> kept together a while, but ere long the two brothers divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among themſelves again, and when the father could not reconcile them, he left the one childe to adhere to the other; but after that differences grew between the father and this one ſon, and they muſt <hi>Anathematize</hi> each other. Here was a lamentable Example to ſee in three perſons of neareſt naturall Relation ſuch an Enmitie, each ſtood aloof from the reſt, all three ſtood <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and <hi>accurſed</hi> by each other. But this <hi>ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and difference I ſpeak of is beyond that, when a man doth <hi>ſeparate</hi> from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and excommunicate it firſt, then after doth Conſcience <hi>ſeparate</hi> from
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:169477:132"/> him, and accurſe him, yea, <hi>and he ſhall be curſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many have thought that they have been able to make <hi>offenſive war</hi> againſt Conſcience, none have ever been able to make the <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</hi> To fight aginſt Conſcience is to fight againſt God, and <hi>who hath ever hardened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job 9. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt him, and proſpered? Pharoab</hi> would begin with God, and make an <hi>offenſive war, Who is the Lord?</hi> I know him not, I will not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go; but he was wearie of the <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi>

                  <hi>Let us flie, for the Lord fighteth againſt us.</hi> So if thou thinkeſt it a light thing to <note place="margin">Exod. 14. 25.</note> challenge and provoke Conſcience, while it would be at peace with thee, know thou wilt finde it <hi>next God himſelf</hi> the heavieſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie that thou couldſt have had.</p>
               <p>If Conſcience be not regarded in his two <hi>firſt Offices,</hi> he will be known in his <hi>two laſt,</hi> if his Miniſteriall reproofs, and Magiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>rods</hi> be ſlighted, he will as a witneſs againſt thee, and a Judge over thee, chaſten thee with <hi>Scorpions. Did not I ſpeak to you,</hi> will Conſcience ſay, as <hi>Reuben</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <note place="margin">Gen 42. 22</note> and you <hi>would not hear</hi> then, ſee now what is come on it, <hi>Now his bloud is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I might adde in the fourth <hi>place,</hi> that which followes in the Text, that when once any have betraied their truſt, and delivered up this <hi>Fort</hi> to Satan, they are ever after <hi>caſhiered</hi> God's ſervice, and are by him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to Satans cuſtodie, and an evil

                  <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 11 Zech. 11. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>be filthie,</hi> and that <hi>which periſheth, let it periſh,</hi> ſaith the Lord in his fierceſt anger; as they had no love to the <hi>truth,</hi> ſo they ſhall have no <hi>Judgement</hi> to diſcern <hi>lies,</hi> but be given over to ſtrong deluſions, to beleeve any lying doctrines, That <hi>all they may be damned who received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12. Thus it befell theſe <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once renounced Conſcience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their faith, they were <hi>diſcharged</hi> any more emploiment; They have no more part in Chriſt, nor lot in the Church, but are delivered up to Satan among blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers.</p>

Satan, all his ſpite is at good Conſcience, all his aim is to make a bad: He <hi>envies</hi> a man nothing but his good Conſcience, not riches, not honours, no learning, parts, duties, not mirth, pleaſure, not his peace, but onely a good Conſcience. He envied not the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> his <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> he could make uſe of it; not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> not <hi>Ahithophel</hi> his <hi>Policy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> nor <hi>Abſalom</hi> his <hi>Beautie,</hi> nor <hi>Haman</hi> his <hi>Court-honours,</hi> or State-offices, nor <hi>Dives</hi> his <hi>wealth</hi> and good <hi>cheer:</hi> He could tell how to make uſe of all. Yea, he will offer his help to men to get them riches, honours, offices, learning,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169477:133"/> ſo they will <hi>quit</hi> good Conſcience: He will grant any <hi>Articles</hi> you can propound, ſo he may gain this <hi>Fort.</hi> He can make uſe of all other things, parts, power, policie, but a good Conſcience is never for <hi>his turn,</hi> in a Magiſtrate, or Miniſter, or in a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but it is conſtantly againſt him, and he againſt it; and therefore he deſpairs of doing any good on it; as they ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> when ſome perſwaded the Pope to attempt to take him off by offering him ſome great preferment, and Church promotions, it was anſwered, it was in vain to trie. <hi>Germana illa beſtia aurum non curat.</hi> That German beaſt <note place="margin">Mel. Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vita Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> (ſaid they) cared not at all for all their gold.</p>
               <p>Yea if a man be <hi>plundered</hi> of all his eſtate, and <hi>ſtormed</hi> out of all his <hi>out-works,</hi> his riches, friends, children, power, places, yea ſtormed out of his nearer <hi>comforts,</hi> out of his faith and hopes, out of his prayers and promiſes, all on the ſudden ſurprized, if he retreat to a good Conſcience, and make good this laſt hold, by a ſtill <hi>retaining of his integritie,</hi> Satan will be repelled with ſhame and loſſe, and draw off with diſhonour, wearie of laying his ſiege againſt ſo impregnable a Fort. <hi>Job</hi> had loſt all, but keeping good Conſcience alone, and manfullie defending this piece, he recovered all again he had loſt, and his <note place="margin">Job 42. 12, 13.</note> laſt ſtate was double to his firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect <hi>of thy ſelf,</hi> or of the <hi>work it ſelf,</hi> thou wilt finde a hard task of it, to get
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169477:134"/> or keep a good Conſcience in an evil age; it will require thy greateſt skill, and utmoſt diligence. So the Apoſtle found it, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 16. therefore he ſaith, <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Some]</hi> Not one ſingle perſon in an age, but it is the caſe of many; not one mans onely, many have miſcarried, and it is <hi>inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all.</hi> Look well to it, <hi>Be not high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some have put away Conſcience]</hi> A mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous vile act, for men ſometimes of better principles, to ſend Conſcience packing like a <hi>vagabond,</hi> or to thruſt it out of doors, as if it were the <hi>Son of the Bondwoman.</hi> It is the moſt unkinde and <hi>ungracious act</hi> that can be, to diſclaim Conſcience, as they did <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> for an intruder, or buſie uſurper, or an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Commander.</p>

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander]</hi> Conſider who theſe were, even great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors a great while, and ſtout Champions ſomewhile, that had adventured far, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged much for the truth, and the Preachers of it; <hi>Alexander</hi> eſpecially, who had ſhewed ſo much zeal to truth, and love to <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:169477:135"/> that to ſecure <hi>Paul</hi>'s perſon, he had expoſed his own to the danger of an unruly tumult; he could have laid down his own life to have ſaved <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and would have parted with his right eye to do <hi>Paul</hi> ſervice. Yet ſee what is become of theſe now; where will he ſtay that hath loſt his Conſcience?</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> are alive again, and by many Profeſſors counted better Preachers then <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy.</hi> Theſe counted Good-Conſcience-Doctrine to be

So that we may more rightly call this an <hi>old-new-Teſtament-error,</hi> to crie down ſtrictneſs, then you, our preaching it an <hi>old-Teſtament</hi> Truth and Doctrine; This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on broke out almoſt as ſoon as the preaching of the Goſpel. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached, <hi>That where ſin had abounded and reigned, grace did much more abound and reign,</hi> Rom. 5. 20. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inferred hence as good Doctrine, and the right knowledg of the Goſpel, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a ſpirit of libertie, Then may we <hi>continue in ſin, that grace may abound,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, ſin ſhall not have dominion over regenerate believers, <hi>For we are not under the law, but grace.</hi> Hence others concluded, <hi>We may ſin, becauſe we are no longer under the Law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14, 15. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the impietie of both Aſſertions with the ſame anſwer, deteſting both, <hi>God forbid,</hi> Rom. 6. 2. &amp; 15. Theſe <hi>Tares</hi> we ſee ſprung up as ſoon as the good Seed began to appear. We wonder the leſs if among us there be ſome that ſay, <hi>Believe</hi> once, and away with Conſcience, and Dutie, and Works, and have no more <hi>Conſcience</hi> of ſin. The truth is, once believe, and thou haſt no more Conſcience of ſin, as to <hi>the guilt and puniſhment of it:</hi> But once believe, and <hi>ever</hi> make conſcience of ſin, to <hi>avoid, reſiſt,</hi> and <hi>mortifie</hi> it, that it

But ſo had <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> There is <hi>Conſcientia mala turbata,</hi> as well as <hi>mala pacata.</hi> Thou maiſt have had great horrour, and a <hi>dreadful ſound in thy ears,</hi> yet onely felt <note place="margin">Job 15. 21.</note> the beginning of ſorrows, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 3.

                  <hi>fire into another.</hi> Then is Death and Hell caſt into the Lake of fire.</p>
               <p>Now there is a troubled Conſcience which is not the better for it. And there is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience troubled again, then which there is no better.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ill troubled</hi> Conſcience is known by <note place="margin">3 Marks of an ill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> theſe three marks: When thoſe troubles have an ill <hi>originall</hi> or riſe, whence they take their beginning. 2. When there is an <hi>ill carriage</hi> and frame of ſpirit under them. 3. When an <hi>ill courſe</hi> is taken to remove them. Then from firſt to laſt theſe troubles are evil troubles.</p>
               <p>1. Troubles are then evil, when the root is <note place="margin">1. When proceed from an evil root and cauſe.</note> evil whence they ſpring. <hi>Ahab</hi> is much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, till he is ſick again, not becauſe his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous luſt is unmortified, but becauſ unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Amnon</hi> is ſick becauſe his brutiſh luſt is nor ſatisfied. <hi>Herod was troubled in his minde,</hi> Mat. 2. 3. <hi>when he heard Chriſt was born.</hi> But
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169477:149"/> no good trouble this, it had no good ſpring, but came from hence, that he feared he ſhould be diſturbed in his Dominion, and his uſurped power ſhould be aboliſhed. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16. There be they that <hi>cannot ſleep if they have done no miſchief all day.</hi> Theſe troubles are not <hi>from</hi> ſin, but <hi>for</hi> it, that they may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Hell is full of ſuch troubled ſpirits. This is indeed the <hi>Devils</hi> trouble, The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit going thorow places, where there is no good to be done (for his purpoſe) ſeeketh reſt, but findeth none. This is <hi>cum diabolo conſcire,</hi> or <hi>conſentire,</hi> and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Devils Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When if it be at all <hi>for ſin,</hi> it is not ſo much for the <hi>intrinſecal</hi> evil and ſinfulneſs that is in ſin, as in regard of the <hi>eventuall</hi> and conſequential evils that attend ſin, and the puniſhment that follows. Thus <hi>Ahab</hi> after his ſin is troubled, walks heavily, puts on ſackcloth, and is humbled, and faſts, and lies in ſackcloth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 27. But all this ado is not for grief of the ſin committed, but for fear of the <hi>puniſhment threatened.</hi> So did <hi>Cain</hi> crie out becauſe of his puniſhment, <hi>Judas</hi> becauſe he muſt be damned, <hi>Magus</hi> deſires praiers that none of thoſe evils told him of by <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould come upon him, and <note place="margin">Act. 8. 24.</note> there was all his trouble. This is to be troubled <hi>for Hell,</hi> not <hi>for ſin.</hi> Hell it ſelf is full of ſuch troubled Conſciences, where there is continuall <hi>weeping, wailing, and</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:169477:150"/> 
                  <hi>gnaſhing of teetb</hi> for their <hi>pains,</hi> but not the leaſt Repentance for their <hi>ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When the <hi>Carriage</hi> under the troubles <note place="margin">2. When attended with an ill carriage under it.</note> is evil, then it is an evil trouble, as 1. when the man doth rage, and ſwell, and ſtorm under the ſtroke of God, <hi>but his uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed heart is never a whit broken, to accept of the puniſhment of his iniquitie. Cain</hi> was troubled enough at his ſentence pronounced by God, he was not troubled aright; it was not at all for his ſin, nor did he at all humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the juſt ſentence of God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and ſtormeth at his puniſhment, <hi>My pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is greater then</hi> I <hi>can bear.</hi> So thoſe Iſai. 8. 21, 22. <hi>who fret themſelves, curſe God, and King,</hi> and all that comes in their way; <hi>And they look upward and downwand upon the earth, and behold trouble and darkneſs, and they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. When you ſee a man go on in ſin under his Troubles, theſe are ill troubles. <hi>Eelix</hi> ſometime trembled while <hi>Paul</hi> was at work upon his Conſcience, but all this trembling did no good upon his Conſcience. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Felix</hi> as he found him, <hi>an incorrigible ſinner,</hi> ſinning againſt checks of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And <hi>Felix</hi> left <hi>Paul</hi> as he found him; He could not be moved ere the more to do <note place="margin">Act. 24. 27. 1 King. 12. 33. 2 Chron. 28. 22.</note> him Juſtice; <hi>Felix left Paul bound. Jeroboam</hi> was as ill, and that wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> much worſe after judgements upon them. <hi>Simon Magis</hi> waxed worſe and worſe after that warning
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169477:150"/> given him by <hi>Peter.</hi> Hell is likewiſe full of ſuch troubled Conſciences, there is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <hi>ſorrowing,</hi> but yet continuall <hi>ſinning.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 11. &amp; 9. 20, 21.</note> They gnaw their tongues, becauſe of their pains; yet blaſpheme God with their tongues, and repent not to give him glorie, as they <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 11. It is not the <hi>thorn</hi> in the hand throbbing and burning which makes the hand well, but the pulling of it out.</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe are ill troubles whoſe <hi>cure</hi> is <note place="margin">3. When an ill cure ſought.</note> evil, or when an evil courſe is taken for their removal, as, 1. When men go to <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means</hi> to remove an inward grief, and go not to God; <hi>Cain</hi> goes and travels firſt, leaves his Countrey, to ſee if he can leave his <hi>ſting</hi> of Conſcience; he afterwards ſettles himſelf to emploiment in building, but <hi>Cain</hi> carries <hi>his hell</hi> with him. <hi>Saul</hi> while his ill fit is on him ſends for <hi>David,</hi> and ſeekes to ſtill his diſtempered ſpirit by his muſick, An ill <hi>Diverſion</hi> doth but <hi>Prorogue,</hi> not end the diſeaſe. It is like the caſting of water upon the outſide of the houſe, when it is all of a flame within; or like the going to the fire in a melancholy Quartan Ague, to get outward heat, when the cold is inward, and the man ſhaketh before the fire, his Aguiſh fit is thereby increaſed, and made more violent.</p>
               <p>2. When men again reſt in the <hi>Outward</hi> uſe and obſervation of <hi>Religious means,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward change of heart, and a thorow-Reformation of life. <hi>Ahab</hi> humbles
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169477:151"/> himſelf, faſts, mourns, puts on ſackcloth, goes ſoftly. <hi>All good,</hi> but all this not <hi>enough;</hi> Good to do theſe, not to reſt in theſe: <hi>Ahab</hi> was <hi>Ahab</hi> ſtill, no inward change at all in him. <hi>Judas</hi> is full of inward horrour, he makes an outward confeſſion of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin, makes plenarie Reſtitution of what he had ſinfully gotten, but there he reſts, he goes not <hi>penitentially</hi> to God; he goes not <hi>fiducially</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom he had ſold, or given up all his former intereſt in: but all this he doth to ſtop the mouth of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and to dead that hideous noiſe that was within. Thus do we ſee others taking up duties often, and here they reſt: They faſt, pray, read, hear more then formerly; all to gratifie Conſcience, and keep it from grumbling and clamor. <hi>Somewhat</hi> they do, <hi>all</hi> they do not, that they ſhould do. All this to a ſin-troubled Conſcience is no more to the cure of it, then a draught of cold water inwardly, or pouring cold water outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a bodie burning in a feaver; It may allay at preſent, but removes no part, or cauſe of his diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe torment, and task themſelves, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves up and down, as <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard on his bed, or the door turning on his hinges; there is no departure from <note place="margin">Pro. 26. 14.</note> the <hi>bed,</hi> or from the <hi>door-Poſt.</hi> So is here much turning, no returning: therefore <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> calls all this but <hi>gadding,</hi> a wilde and diſorderly gadding, not a regular going, or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169477:151"/> penitent returning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 36. <hi>Why gaddeſt thou about ſo much to change thy way?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, which is <hi>much worſe</hi> then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when men have recourſe to <hi>Diabolical</hi> and ſinful means, as <hi>Saul</hi> goes to the witch, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 7, 8. 2 King. 1. 2</note> 
                  <hi>Abaziah</hi> ſendeth to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> to enquire, ſendeth not to enquire of God. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in his perplexitie ſends for the Magicians to give him comfort. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 7.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, which is worſt of all, when men <hi>deſpairingly</hi> give over all <hi>hopes,</hi> and all uſe of <hi>means,</hi> ſaying, <hi>There is now no hope.</hi> This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 25. &amp; 18. 12.</note> evil in <hi>putting away Gods mercie,</hi> is worſe then all the former, in abuſing and <hi>defiling</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:169477:152"/> Gods mercie; As <hi>Tamar</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amnon;</hi> this latter evil in putting me away is worſe then the former.

                  <hi>ſentenced,</hi> I muſt be <hi>damned;</hi> I am <hi>accurſed,</hi> I muſt <hi>bear</hi> it; <hi>God</hi> hath no <hi>mercie</hi> for me, and <hi>none</hi> will I ask him. Out he goes from the Preſence of <hi>God,</hi> full of black deſpair, his countenance is caſt down, and he that was of late too ſtout to ſpeak to his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> is now as ſtout and ſullen, he will not once open his mouth to ſpeak to <hi>God</hi> for a pardon. So likewiſe <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, reſtored, but deſpairing of mercie never once went to ſpeak with <hi>Chriſt</hi> to finde mercie. So alſo <hi>Magus</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> bade Repent and pray, then perhaps his ſin might have been forgiven him. Hee never made one Praier, or ſo much as once ſet upon the work of Repentance. This is trouble of Conſcience that <hi>Hell</hi> is full of. This the moſt deſperate trouble in the world, when one ſhall caſt himſelf away wilfully, and ſay, This evil is of the Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33. <hi>why ſhould I wait, or pray, or repent, or believe, or read, or hear, &amp;c?</hi> This is to <hi>forſake our own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi> A childe of God may ſometimes bee <note place="margin">Jonah 2. 8.</note> overwhelmed with troubles, but he is ſtill driven <hi>to God</hi> thereby, not <hi>from God:</hi> He ſaith, I am diſtreſſed on every ſide, yet I am <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> not in <hi>deſpair:</hi> To <hi>deſpair</hi> I have cauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of my own <hi>deſert;</hi> To deſpair I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have cauſe in reſpect of <hi>Gods mercie,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Redemption.</hi> In diſtreſs I am, in <hi>Hell</hi> I

               </p>
               <p>Now there is alſo a <hi>troubled Conſcience,</hi> then which there can be none better, it is the <hi>Sacrifice of Sacrifices</hi> which God will not <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 17 Iſai. 57. 17. &amp; 66. 2.</note> deſpiſe; it is the <hi>Temple of Temples,</hi> in which God hath promiſed his reſidence; it is the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> in which the Mercie-ſeat of God is placed.</p>
               <p>And this trouble of Conſcience is then <note place="margin">Six notes of a good troubled Conſcience</note> good when you ſee theſe ſix notes there:</p>

               <p>Much was ſpoken at firſt of the evil haunts <note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> of this Conſcience, we may therefore ſay the leſs here, we ſhall onely adde ſome of his common Marks whereby it may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; it is impoſſible to enumerate all his Wiles, and Exorbitancies: Some and his chief among them wee ſhall name:</p>
               <p n="1">1. His grand and greateſt miſtake is to leave the <hi>Word</hi> which is the <hi>ſtanding Rule</hi> to a rectified and judicious Conſcience, and to prefer a <hi>Tradition,</hi> or ſome humane invention before an expreſs Precept. Thus did the Phariſees, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Erroneous Conſcience leaveth the <hi>waters of Siloah,</hi> the holy Scriptures, that ran ſoftly, and uniformly, and conſtantly, and takes extraordinarie <hi>Providence</hi> for a Rule in ſtead of <hi>Precepts:</hi> whereas Gods Providences <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 3.

But erroneous Conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes his ſucceſs to his cauſe, and his cauſe proſpering he entitles God's cauſe. This was <hi>Rabſhakehs Divinitie, Am I come hither</hi>

                  <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This was the <hi>Divinitie</hi> of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> Hab. 1. 11. <hi>Then ſhall his minde change</hi> (with his ſucceſs) <hi>and he ſhall paſs over, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, imputing this his power to his God.</hi> Theſe are apt to ſay <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 7. <hi>We offend not, becauſe they have ſinned,</hi> and we have <hi>prevailed.</hi> But if Gods Permiſſive Providence, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſucceſs make any thing lawfull, what is then ſinfull, that is in our power? Then were not God's written will, but our will and power (Providence concurring) the Rule and Meaſure of lawfull and unlawfull. But Providences are various and uncertain, Our Rule muſt be conſtant and certain. Providence can never be made a Rule; for firſt, no Concluſion thence can be certain and infallible, ſaith the wiſe man <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>All things come alike to all, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that <hi>none can know love or hatred by all that is before him.</hi> Secondly, The ſucceſs which God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his Providence lay out for men is ſhort of mans <hi>Expectation,</hi> and the moſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious</hi> endeavours, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Gods wiſe and ſecret Providence doth oft diſappoint and fruſtrate the expectation of the wiſeſt and the beſt of men, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>There is a juſt man that periſheth in his righteouſneſs, and a wicked man who prolongeth his life in his wickedneſs.</hi> The like he ſaith again <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 14. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Providences are <hi>various,</hi> and full of <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> that it were a brutiſh kinde of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to conclude any thing poſitively
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169477:155"/> thence concerning the minde of God, or the ſtate of man. Then when <hi>Paul</hi> and all his companie eſcape their ſhipwrack, they muſt be all <hi>Saints;</hi> when the Viper is on his hand he muſt be a <hi>murderer</hi> now, and when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is in the fire, he muſt be a God again. All the conſequences alike valid. Fit Divinitie this for <hi>Barbarians,</hi> not for Chriſtians. But <hi>Solomon</hi> would have us ceaſe from ſuch kind of daring reaſonings, when he concludes <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. <hi>ult. I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot finde out the work that is done under the ſun, becauſe though a man labour to ſeek it out, yea further, though a wiſe man think to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to finde it out.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. It prefers a ſtrong impulſion from his own thoughts before <hi>Gods own thoughts,</hi> Jer. 7. 31. God ſaid what they did <hi>never came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his minde</hi> to approve it, yet would they do it, becauſe it was their Conſcience, and it came into their minde. But the ſtrongeſt impulſion of our ſpirits, though <hi>gracious</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, can be no Rule. <hi>David</hi> had a very ſtrong impreſſion once to build God a houſe, he conſults with <hi>Nathan</hi> a Prophet, he hath the <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 2, 3.</note> ſame apprehenſion of the work, <hi>Go on, for</hi>

                  <hi>God is with thee,</hi> yet was it not therefore good in Gods eyes, becauſe good in both theirs. <hi>David</hi> had another vehement and impetuous Motion to be avenged on <hi>Nabal</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 22.</note> and uncivilities towards his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ſent in his name, he backs that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an <hi>Oath;</hi> yet upon <hi>Abigails</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he changeth his minde, bleſſing both <note place="margin">ver. 33.</note> God and her, and the counſell given to ſtay him from proceeding ſo fiercely according to the wilde light of an erring Conſcience. God did appoint his people under the Law <note place="margin">Numb. 15. 39.</note> to wear <hi>fringes</hi> on their <hi>garments,</hi> that they might remember Gods <hi>written Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and not ſeek after their <hi>own heart, after which they were apt to go a whoring.</hi> He that truſteth <hi>in his own heart is a fool,</hi> the wiſe man <note place="margin">Pro. 28. 26</note> ſaith. And <hi>Job</hi> gives a ſerious <hi>Item</hi> in this caſe. <hi>Let not him that is deceived truſt in vanitie: for vanitie ſhall be his recompenſe.</hi> Job 15. 31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Erroneous Conſcience interprets <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> and <hi>diſcouragements</hi> as a diſcharge from dutie. <hi>The time is not come,</hi> ſay they, to build the Houſe of God, nor is it any more our dutie; becauſe the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad, and the adverſaries hindered it. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. But this is the <hi>ſluggards</hi> Conſcience when <hi>he ſeeth a lion in the way,</hi> Prov. 26. 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It conceives a fair intention, or a good end may legitimate an unwarrantable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now though true it is, That the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the end propounded hath a great <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> upon an action to make it <hi>theologically</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:169477:156"/> good; yet can no good end alter the nature of an action that is <hi>materially</hi> bad to mend it. To do the greateſt good to an evil end (as <hi>to pray to be ſeen of men)</hi> and to do the leaſt evil to attain the beſt end (as <hi>to lie for God)</hi> are <note place="margin">Job 13. 7.</note> alike abomination. Our Rule from the Scripture is not to do the leaſt evil to gain the greateſt beneficiall good, or to avoid the greateſt penall evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, this fool ſo rageth, and is ſo confident, that he dare appeal to God, to patronize his exorbitancies, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 3. They think they did God greateſt ſervice when they did the Church the greateſt diſ-ſervice in killing the Apoſtles. So did <hi>Pauls</hi> erring Conſcience once ſtimulate him, <hi>Out of zeal perſecuting the Church,</hi> Phil. 3. 6. <hi>Jehu</hi> could not look upon it as any other then true zeal to God, when he ſaw himſelf ſo violent in rooting out <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, and <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> ſaith he. And were there not fourty zealouſly enraged againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> who had made a religious vow, <hi>not to eat again unleſs they had killed Paul?</hi>

                  <hi>Quantum Religio poterit ſuadere malorum!</hi> what ſo evil that erroneous Conſcience will not call good? It puts bitter for ſweet, and darkneſs for light familiarly.</p>
               <p>7. The next miſtake is of them who mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake a <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> Conſcience for a good Conſcience, whenas all their <hi>ſcruples</hi> are about minute, and triviall matters, about indifferent or impertinent things, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169477:156"/> things of greater conſequence; they ſtand upon <hi>Tythe Mint, Anniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cummin, and neglect the weightie matters of the Law, Mercie, Juſtice, Faith; Strain at a gnat, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a camel,</hi> ſtick at joyning with a Chriſtian Congregation in the commanded duties of publike worſhip and Communion, but never ſtick at joining with ſcorners in <hi>ſinful communion,</hi> or in conforming to the faſhions of the world.

Theſe make ado about waſhing pots, and cups, and outſides, when the heart is brim full of pride, hypocriſie, malice, cenſoriouſneſs, rapine, and all iniquitie; ſcruple rubbing ears of corn when hungrie, but not ſwallowing a poor widows houſe. The high Prieſts were troubled in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and rent their clothes, when Chriſt ſaid <hi>he was the Son of God;</hi> but when themſelves blaſphemed Chriſt, and reſiſted the holy Ghoſt, there was then no <hi>rending hearts,</hi> nor <hi>renting garments.</hi> When <hi>Judas</hi> brought back the money and threw it down, they would not once <hi>touch</hi> it, and into their <hi>Corban it muſt not come,</hi> it was the <hi>Price of blood</hi> now; but when they drove the bargain with <hi>Judas,</hi> and told him out that very money, then it was not <hi>the price of blood,</hi> out of <hi>Corban</hi> it might lawfully come, but <hi>into Corban</hi> again it muſt not go.

What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of Wiſdom, I may ſay of good Conſcience the trueſt Wiſdom, <hi>Get wiſdom, get underſtanding, above all thy get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 5, 6, 7.</note> So ſay I, Get a good Conſcience, keep a good Conſcience, above all getting get it, above all keeping keep it; forſake not her, ſhe ſhall preſerve thee; love her, ſhe ſhall keep thee. She is a tree of life to them that <note place="margin">Prov. 3. 18.</note>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:169477:160"/> lay hold on her, happie he that retaineth her. But loſe this, and loſe thy ſoul; hate this and love death. Good Conſcience is the <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 39.</note> charge we travell with, whatever danger we may meet with in our way, we muſt run, or fight, or die, or fly for it, rather then deliver up ſuch a charge. Good Conſcience is the Ship in which we embarque and adventure all we have, Credit, State, Libertie, Life, and Soul too, as <hi>Noab</hi> put all into one Bottome, all his Familie, all the Catholike Church, and the Reſerve of the whole world, and all was ſafe. This <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſel</hi> or <hi>Man of war</hi> muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be yeelded up, but rather we muſt ſink and periſh in the defenſe of it. Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is our <hi>ſtrong Fort,</hi> which we muſt upon no terms capitulate to deliver up to the enemie, but chuſe rather to die upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Secondly, look upon <hi>Timothie</hi> as a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> and this doth further inform us, That a good Conſcience is the good <hi>Miniſters</hi> great Charge. This charge I commit to thee, Son <hi>Timothie,</hi> to hold Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Theſe are <hi>Arma Miniſtri,</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters weapons. The Miniſter muſt be a man <hi>of Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>for Conſcience</hi> wholly. This is the <hi>floore</hi> he muſt daily purge. This the <hi>garden</hi> which he muſt dreſs and keep. The <hi>living ſtone</hi> which he muſt hew and poliſh, to make Temples for Chriſt of. This the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> into which the Goſpel-Miniſter muſt daily enter. Faith and good
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169477:160"/> Conſcience are his principall weapons he muſt be moſt expert in, and exerciſing at both in Perſon and Pulpit. This is to preach the whole counſell of God, to preach Faith in God, and Conſcience in men. To ſay that Conſcience is a <hi>Dutie</hi> is too little, it is the Summe of all <hi>Duties.</hi> To call good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a <hi>Grace</hi> is too little, it is the Summe of all Graces. It is <hi>Totum Dei,</hi> The whole Command of God. It is <hi>Totum homi is,</hi> The whole Dutie of man. Good Conſcience is the <hi>Contents</hi> of the whole Bible, and all the Scripture bound up in a ſmall Volume. Will you hear in one word the ſumme of all, Keep Faith and a good Conſcience, This is the whole dutie of man; The ſumme of the firſt Table is Epitomized in one word, <hi>Love God with all thy heart.</hi> Of the ſecond in another word, <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> But the ſumme of both Tables of the Law, and all duties of the Goſpel is reduced to this one word <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Haſt thou Conſcience? Thou doſt fulfill the firſt: haſt thou Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? Thou wilt fulfill the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thou O man of God look well to thy Charge, thy own and thy Peoples Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Herein muſt thou daily exerciſe thy ſelf as a workman, who needeth not to bee aſhamed to keep thy ſelf pure, and to keep thy peoples Conſcience without offenſe to God and man; <hi>warning every man, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Col. 1. 28.

               <p>Thirdly, this informes us in particular how it comes that ſo many daily break in Citie and Countrey, making ſhipwrack of Credit, of States, and Families, the matter is, they were broken at home firſt in their Conſciences, then they muſt needs break abroad. Break Conſcience, and thou art broken, none thrive after it. This makes the worſt bankrupts, it makes a man to be out of Credit with God, and in his own heart. A moth or worm in Conſcience is commonly followed with a moth and worm in the eſtate. The inheritance haſtily gotten, is as ſoon waſted. <hi>From the hire of an harlot if it came, to the hire of an harlot it returns,</hi> Micah 1. 7. They ever who take more care to get great States, then good Conſciences, do but conſult ſhame to their Honours, and ruine to their Houſes, They are like the <hi>fooliſh woman who puls down her houſe with her own hands.

               <p>4. This diſcovers yet a worſe decaie then that of temporall States, the Ground of that Decaie in Grace; whence it is that there are ſo many broken Profeſſours, bankrupts in Religion, and decaied Apoſtates in the Church. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> this broke their backs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were men ſometimes of as good account, and great eſteem as any other men in all that rich and mightie Citie <hi>Epheſus,</hi> forward men, very likely to make

When good Conſcience once departs, the unclean ſpirit comes in, and takes poſſeſſion, brings in ſeven unclean ſpirits into a houſe formerly emptie, ſwept and garniſhed, they dwell and ſtay there, till the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt.

               <p>8. This informs us whence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to die ſo <hi>Tragically,</hi> deſpairingly, and to make ſuch fearfull ends. They have like <hi>Zimri</hi> ſet their own houſe (of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) afire, and now muſt <hi>periſh</hi> in it. Some have <hi>attempted</hi> to make away themſelves; ſome have done it, as <hi>Saul, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thophel;</hi> ſome have accurſed themſelves, as <hi>Spira;</hi> ſome have blaſphemed God, as <hi>Cain,</hi> and they mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 11. All fruits of this ſhipwrack of Conſcience.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:169477:165"/> and grieveſt thy <hi>own Conſcience,</hi> thou offendeſt againſt <hi>Pietie,</hi> and therefore thou ſinneſt againſt, and grieveſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt.

               <p>The conſumption of Conſcience doth not onely bring the outward ſtate into a conſumption, that ſuch die beggers, or bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, but it as uſually brings the inward man into fits of <hi>Convulſions,</hi> which are hardly cured, and at laſt they die in one of thoſe fits in <hi>great horrour.</hi> When Conſcience hath been often fretted, and grated upon by known and allowed ſins, at length it breeds an <hi>

               <p>9.

The moſt of men ſay that ſhee is either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, or drawing on toward her departure:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:169477:167"/> And prophane ones ſay, that Conſcience was hanged many a day ago; indeed my Text tells us that ſhee was drowned long ago, and periſhed in ſhipwrack; but they are much miſtaken to ſay it was good Conſcience, for it was the ill Conſcience that periſhed. The Good Conſcience fears neither the <hi>Gallowes,</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> it is the beſt Preſervative againſt both. But ſad it is that there is ſo little reckoning made of Conſcience now adaies. <hi>Bernards</hi> old complaint may be renewed, <hi>Multi Scientiam, pauci Conſcientiam quaerunt. Many are for Science, few for Conſcience.</hi> In ſtead of that <hi>Double Knowledge</hi> of which we ſpake at firſt (for ſuch is Conſcience) we have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſingle, which is <hi>Speculation,</hi> and therefore in ſtead of ſingle dealing (ſuch is Sinceritie) we have too much of double, which is <hi>Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</hi> In former time we were wont to call the Godly man, The <hi>conſcientious man, The man of conſcience.</hi> Now we commend the man of Parts, and the able man; whereas when all is done, the Conſcionable man will be found the <hi>able man.</hi> And this better part is the beſt Parts. <hi>The man of wiſdom is the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>man of ſtrength,</hi> ſaid the wiſe man; though now we call the proud happie, and the bold, and daring man we call wiſe, judicious, prudent. But did not our fathers hearts, and Lives, and Dealings excell ours much more then our knowledge, gifts, and light exceed theirs? They might deſire <hi>to ſee our daies</hi> for Libertie of Profeſſion, and Puritie
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:169477:167"/> of Ordinances; and we may deſire to ſee their dayes again for ſtrictneſs of life, ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and uprightneſs in their dealing. They had more Conſcience, though leſs Knowledge; we have more Knowledge, but leſs Conſcience; we have greater Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, they had better men; they were more for Devotion, we are more for Diſputation. As <hi>Seneca</hi> commended former times, when men ſtrove rather to do well and virtuouſly, then to ſpeak well, and eloquently; but blamed the following times, when men had got the art of ſpeaking accurately, but loſt the Habit of doing worthily. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi docti pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierunt, boni eſſe deſierunt.</hi> So may we ſay of our times compared with thoſe of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. We have all learnt to ſpeak the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet live the life of <hi>Canaanites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have yeelded up our <hi>two Forts,</hi> Faith and Good Conſcience, the <hi>Bulwarks of Chriſtendom</hi> (as I may call them, of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi> they are) unto the enemie; That of <hi>Faith</hi> into the hands of <hi>infidelitie, errour,</hi> and <hi>hereſie;</hi> and that of <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> into the hands of <hi>hypocriſie, impietie, Libertiniſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where is our old Engliſh Sinceritie to be found? Our firſt Love to old truths? Our zeal for God? Contending for the Faith? Our Humilitie of life? Our ſtrictneſs and exact walking? It was a great reproach to Iſrael, that there was <hi>more faith found in one Centurion,</hi> (him an Heathen) then in all of <note place="margin">Luke 7. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:169477:168"/> them again; and what a diſhonor is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that there was more of ſingleneſs of heart, more of Faith, of Love, of all Pietie to be found in <hi>our fathers</hi> in the daies of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Reformation, then is to be found in a Land <hi>profeſſing righteouſneſs,</hi> and by Covenant engaged to Perſonall and Exemplarie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?

How much is it to be lamented that all the uſe that many make of the preſent light of the Goſpel, is but to light them into the chambers of death, and this onely benefit they have by it, that they do not go to Hell in the dark, as others have done. Theſe when they come at death to reflect on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may take up <hi>Nero</hi>'s words, and cry out, <hi>Quantus Artifex pereo!</hi> How great an Artiſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:169477:168"/> was I to undo my ſelf! and how great skill had I to go to Hell!</p>
               <p>2. And here have we not juſt cauſe to proceed in our Lamentation further, when we take notice not onely of the want of Conſcience in the moſt, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Conſcience in the beſt; but when we have been beholders of the fatall and frequent ſhipwracks of good Conſcience that have been made in theſe tempeſtuous and Faith-trying times to the hazarding of the loſs both of Church and State, both of Truth and Peace!</p>
               <p>Wracks and Loſſes at Sea, if many together and frequent, whether the Veſſels be taken by Pyrates, or caſt away by Tempeſts, tend to the decaying and impoveriſhing of the greateſt States and Kingdomes, All being concerned in ſuch a Loſs, Commodities thereupon growing more ſcarce, and dear. Though the Loſs be greateſt to the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and Owners, who are uſually undone thereby, and their backs broken, as we ſay.</p>
               <p>How ſad and diſmall a ſight is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a ſhip now neer her ſinking in the depth of the Sea, whether it happen through the Pilots careleſneſs ſplitting againſt a rock, or the Mariners ſlackneſs to do their dutie at the Pump, and ſtopping Leaks, or through the badneſs of the Veſſell? But what a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable <note place="margin">Exoritur clamorque virum ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorque ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentum.</note> ſpectacle is it exceeding all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion! what hideous noiſe is then made? what crying out? what taking on? what
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:169477:169"/> running up and down? what catching hold? But whether can they run? what can they catch hold of? They are all at their wits end: they periſh both young and old all together; buried all alive in one vaſt and inſatiable grave. What a ſudden? what a horrid? what a Totall? what an irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Loſs is there all at once? A <hi>ſudden</hi> Loſs of all their goods, a <hi>horrid</hi> Loſs of all their Perſons and Lives, a <hi>totall</hi> Loſs of the ſhip and all in her. An <hi>irrecoverable</hi> Loſs of All.</p>
               <p>In one ſhipwrack a thouſand may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and very many utterly undone. A ſhipwrack is more dreadfull then the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of <hi>fire</hi> ordinarily; The water being the more mercileſs and maſterleſs Element of the two, though both dreadfull, and in many things alike amazing and undoing:</p>
               <p>Yet 1. <hi>Fire</hi> doth not uſually break out on ſuch a ſudden: This may be in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>2. From the <hi>Fire</hi> ſomewhat ordinarily may be reſerved by carrying away the goods off the Ground: What can be preſerved here?</p>
               <p>3. From the <hi>Fire</hi> the man, whoſe houſe is conſuming, may eſcape, and ſave himſelf and his little ones, though he have not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie to remove his goods: Here is no flying here.</p>
               <p>4. In a dangerous <hi>Fire</hi> the Neighbours come neer offering their common contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:169477:169"/> to help to ſtay it: Here who can come neer to reſcue?</p>
               <p>5. In the <hi>fire</hi> one part of the houſe may be conſumed, and another end of it kept up ſtanding: But here no part of ſhip, or goods, or perſons preſerved, all fare alike, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together.</p>
               <p>6. There if friends cannot help, they can condole, and lament their impoveriſhed neighbours condition, which is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them: Here is none to help, none to comfort, none to pitie, or ſo much as to pray for thee.</p>
               <p>7. There when the <hi>fire</hi> hath done his worſt, the ground yet remains, where a new houſe may be built again; ſomewhat there is to be ſeen (though but heaps of Aſhes) that tells the Paſſenger, Here ſtood ſuch a houſe. But here all is ſwallowed up in an inſtant, and their place no more ſeen.</p>
               <p>8. There the man commonly out-lives his calamitie, and through the bleſſing of God, and charitie of neighbours, the houſe is rebuilt, the ſtate is repaired, the man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf, and lives as well again as ever he did before. Here the man, and his goods, and his Veſſell periſh all together.</p>
               <p>But yet if any ſhipwrack be in any thing more lamentable then <hi>fire,</hi> This metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall and ſpirituall ſhipwrack is infinitely more dreadfull, undoing, and irrecoverable then any other ſhipwrack.</p>
               <p>And yet how many ſuch ill Accidents (as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:169477:170"/> we call them) have befallen this rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing <hi>Iſland</hi> in theſe late tempeſtuous times? Many fearfull ſhipwracks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have been made by Perſons of all Qualities, and Profeſſions, not onely to the hazard and loſs of all their own former comfortable ſtate, the loſs of Grace, and Peace, and Hopes, yea which is above all, their Souls ſinking in Eternall perdition, but alſo to the damage and detriment of the whole. What loſs hath there been of men who for their parts might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding uſefull in Church and State, had they not miſcarried? who can ſumme up the value our goods loſt amount unto? not onely outward goods of Peace, Plentie, Riches, Wealth, Treaſure, Power, Credit loſt and gone; but of richer and choicer goods, goods of Grace, our former Faith, Love, Sinceritie, Unitie, Holineſs, Zeal, and common Intereſt in Church-Reformation, and withall the loſs of thoſe rich and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Comforts they ſometimes had of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Joy and ſpirituall Peace, beſides the hazard of their Souls eternall ſafetie. But which is of more common concernment, The Ship it ſelf in which we are all embarqued being endangered to be caſt away. Both Church and State by ſuch mens means put into ſo doubtfull a condition.</p>

               <p>How do men enquire for good purchaſes, good bargains, good houſes, good wives, good portions, good wares, good credit, yea, a good ſervant, and a good horſe; they would have all good, yet care not what their conſcience is: they get rich cloathing on their backs (ſaith <hi>Bernard)</hi> but have miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">

               <p> The ſenſe of <hi>Externall feeling</hi> is the firſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the life of nature, this ſenſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall feeling</hi> is the firſt and beſt diſcoverie of the life of Grace, He that hath not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſprinkled, purged, quickned, renewed, and of a new impreſſion, is not at all of God yet, nor belongeth to him, Becauſe he neither hath his <hi>Image</hi> nor his <hi>Superſcription.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither ſhall he ever have Glory, which is the ſecond thing.</p>

And there they ſhall be for a continuall monitor &amp; remembrance, that they ſhall need the leſſe of outward teaching and humane Laws, they having an inward Directer, and Admoniſher, and a Divine Law within.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:169477:182"/> ſeen. We can diſcourſe and diſpute better than our Fathers; they could and did live better. <hi>Liberty</hi> hath like <hi>Reuben</hi> climbed up into his <hi>Mother Conſcience</hi>'s bed, and there hath defiled it, therefore loſeth the <hi>Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> and <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and <hi>ſhall not excell.</hi> And as for <hi>Purity, Charity, Tenderneſſe, Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe, Sincerity,</hi> and the like, we have ſent them afar off, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the Children of the <hi>Concubines.</hi> But if theſe things were in us, and did abound, we ſhould not be ſo barren, and frigid, and unfruitfull in the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as we are, whereas for lack of theſe things men are blind, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about queſtions to no profit, but to the corrupting of the Speaker, and ſubverting of the Hearers.</p>
               <p>As we are wont to ſay of a <hi>Scholler</hi> going to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie,</hi> if he do not as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">Qui proficit in Dectina &amp; deficit in moribus, non profitit ſeâ deficit.</note> in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> (in his Behaviour and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals) as he doth in his Logick, or in Arts and Tongues, he doth not profit but loſe: So may we well ſay of the Profeſſor, if he profit not as much in Conſcience as in bare Science and Opinions, his Proficiency is but a Deficiency.</p>
               <p>Who doth not look upon the <hi>Toad</hi> as a hatefull creature, although it have a <hi>Pearle</hi> in his head, becauſe it is full of <hi>Poyſon</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and all ſpeckled without? what is that man to be valued, who hath a Pearle of knowledge in his brain, if another had it, but his inward parts are very wickedneſſe, he ſwels with poyſonous Pride within, and his life ſpotted abroad?</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:169477:182"/>
               <p> But here is the difference you ſhall alway find between the knowledg of an <hi>Hyppocrite,</hi> and the true <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The Hypocrites knowledge is like the light of the increaſing <hi>Moon,</hi> which increaſeth in <hi>Light</hi> and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe onely, not at all in <hi>Heat.</hi> But the light of the true Chriſtian is like the <hi>riſing Sun</hi> in the morning, or the <hi>Vernal Sunne</hi> in the Spring, where <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi> are conjoyned, the darkneſſe and coldneſſe of the night is leſſened, the heat of the day is increaſed. The Moon grows <hi>lighter</hi> and <hi>lighter,</hi> and <hi>bigger</hi> and <hi>bigger,</hi> but not <hi>hotter</hi> and <hi>hotter:</hi> Her <hi>Plenilunium</hi> or full is as cold as her Wane. But the riſing Sun we all ſee doth not onely go <hi>higher and higher,</hi> but growes <hi>hotter and hotter.</hi> The Hypocrite hath onely an <hi>increaſe in knowledge</hi> in his <hi>Plenilunium</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> he hath no heat in <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> to be diſcerned, the true Chriſtian hath both light and heat increaſing alike together.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>four-fold knowledge</hi> in the world, a knowledge of <hi>Speculation,</hi> which is the <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> knowledge; a knowledge joined with <hi>diſlike</hi> and diſobedience which is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Devils;</hi> a knowledg joyned with <hi>delectation</hi> and complacency, which is the <hi>Angels</hi> knowledge; And the knowledge joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Conſcience</hi> and good affections, which is the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hypocrite with all his ſwelling knowledge is like thoſe children which have the Rickets, whoſe <hi>head</hi> indeed growes big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than another childs, but their <hi>ſtrength</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:169477:183"/> leſſe, they fall into an <hi>Atrophy,</hi> they thrive not, but pine away and die. So the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites <hi>head</hi> is unproportionable to his other parts, he is <hi>ſwollen big</hi> with notions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but thrives not in <hi>ſubſtantial graces,</hi> and grows not ſtrong in Faith and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Look therefore every one to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hereby know thy ſtate; look well that if thou haſt not yet got a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou mayeſt ſeek to <hi>get</hi> one; if thou haſt, then ſeek to <hi>hold</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> it; if thou haſt loſt it, ſeek to <hi>recover</hi> it; if it be evil, get it <hi>amended;</hi> if ignorant, get it <hi>informed,</hi> if er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, get it <hi>rectified;</hi> if dead, <hi>quickened;</hi> if hard, <hi>ſoftened;</hi> if aſleep, <hi>awakened;</hi> if cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, <hi>purified;</hi> if unquiet, <hi>pacified.</hi>

               <p> Firſt to each <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of any thing, that he eſpecially make it his care to get a good Conſcience, and to keep it.

               <p>What the <hi>Orator</hi> anſwered to one deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what was principally neceſſary to make a good <hi>Orator? Pronounciation,</hi> ſaid he. What ſecond? <hi>Pronounciation.</hi> What third? <hi>Pronounciation</hi> he anſwered ſtill, as if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation did chiefly and wholly make a compleat Orator. So do you ask what is moſt neceſſary to make a good Chriſtian? I anſwer <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And what next if you ask? I anſwer ſtill <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſtill ſay I.</p>
               <p>As of the Scholler comming from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity, when he hath been a Student for many years, the beſt Teſtimony which can be given him, is, that he hath profited <hi>Tam do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinâ
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:169477:184"/> quam moribus,</hi> In <hi>Learning and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> So the beſt Teſtimony that can be given of a Chriſtan going from the Church, when he hath been a frequent hearer, is, That he hath profited <hi>tam ſcientiâ quam Conſcientiâ,</hi> both in <hi>ſcience, and in Conſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To back and ſtrengthen this exhortation, I ſhall firſt lay down ſome <hi>Motives</hi> to inforce, then ſome <hi>Means</hi> to direct to the better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and retaining a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Let this <hi>move</hi> firſt, that God doth weigh <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>1</label> and try the Conſcience of a man. The <hi>Lord weigheth the Spirits</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Gold and <note place="margin">Pro. 16. 2.</note> Silver men do weigh, Grace and Spirits men cannot. God weigheth not Gold or Silver, or Honours, or Eſtates; but he onely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Spirits and Conſciences</hi> of men. So much of Conſcience as is in any perſon, or duty, or action or ſuffering, ſo much of thank and worth with God. <hi>This is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy with God, if a man for Conſcience ſuffer and take it patiently.</hi> That <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction</hi> is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated good, that proceeds from a principle of Conſcience, that <hi>ſuffering</hi> good which is for Conſcience. So much Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, ſo much Comfort is coming to thee from God. So much <hi>Conſcience</hi> before God, ſo much <hi>confidence</hi> before God.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, if Conſcience be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Motive </seg>2</label> wanting, a man ſhall ſuffer loſſe of all he hath, and loſe the thing he hath done or ſuffered, or expended. When a man ſhall ſay with <hi>Jehu,</hi> See my zeal for the Lord; I have faſted, I hove fought, I have been active,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:169477:185"/> I have ſuffered. God will ſay, Have you faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all to me? have you done all this out of Conſcience? <hi>When you faſted, was it not to your ſelves? and when you did eat, was it not to your ſelves?</hi> therefore <hi>walk in the ſparks which you have kindled.</hi> If you have done well and truly, Conſcientiouſly and Religiouſly (as <hi>Jotham</hi> ſaid once) do you then rejoyce in <note place="margin">Jud. 9. 19.</note> Conſcience, and let Conſcience rejoyce in you: but if otherwiſe, a fire will break out of that <hi>bramble</hi> the evil Conſcience, and conſume you and all your works. What a mighty ſtickler was <hi>Jehu,</hi> a man of an active and impetuous ſpirit? yet he loſt his reward for all his pains and ſeeming zeal, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was not right. <hi>Ananias</hi> loſt his <hi>coſt</hi> &amp; <hi>charges</hi> after he had contributed ſo much. <hi>Alexander</hi> loſt his reward and comfort after he had ſuffered ſo much <hi>Judas</hi> loſt al after he had followed Chriſt ſo long, and preached Chriſt to others ſo often.</p>

               <p>The <hi>firſt woc</hi> may be a ſad one, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long, becauſe life is ſhort: The <hi>ſecond woe</hi> is more ſad, becauſe more long, but though long it is, it is not for ever: The <hi>third</hi> is the ſad and <hi>killing woe,</hi> becauſe it is both long and endleſſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Eternity</hi> is a pit which hath no bottome, it is a large <hi>bottome</hi> that can never be unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, it is a <hi>Center</hi> which hath no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, no meaſure of times, or number of Ages can fathom or reckon the length of it.

So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. <hi>The bloud of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is that whereby the beleever is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. Whatſoever other means are uſed, &amp; courſes are taken, as by confeſſion, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſatisfaction, reading, praying, faſting, building Alms-houſes or the like, they are no more (without this) to the commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Conſcience unto God, or taking away ſin from the Conſcience, than <hi>Adams Fig-leaves</hi> to take away the ſhame of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; or the waſhing of <hi>Pilates hands</hi> in fair water to cleanſe his ſoul from the foul ſin of Bioud-guiltineſſe.

This is the firſt and great Experiment to be uſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is like unto it, namely this, <note place="margin">2. The Spirit of Chriſt.</note> to get and ſeek the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> which is the next <hi>principal</hi> ingredient in, or efficient of a good Conſcience. It is the Spirit of God with our Spirit, that makes the good Conſcience. In this ſenſe we may allow that of <hi>Origen,</hi> That Conſcience is another Spirit in the ſoul: therefore the Apoſtle ſaith of his Conſcience, that it did bear him <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 1.</note> witneſſe in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The ſingle Teſtimonie of natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not much to be regarded in many caſes; but when Conſcience is cleared by the Spirit, and ſeconded with the Spirit, the Teſtimony of theſe two is great and weighty, the Spirit of God witneſſing thus to our ſpirit, is the cleareſt Teſtimony of <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> of our Adoption and Salvation, which thy
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:169477:193"/> Conſcience alone is not to be credited in; for what could the light of our body (the eye) ſee and diſcern, if it were not for the light of the Heaven (the Sun?) we ſhould have a continuall Night. So without the Spirit, the light of God, what can Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, our light, ſee and diſcern of the things of God? Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> that God doth <hi>reveal unto his ſervants the deep myſteries of the Goſpel by his ſpirit; for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? So the things of God knoweth no man but the ſpirit of God. Now we have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we may know the things which are freely given to us of Cod, &amp;c.</hi> So that whereſoever the ſpirit of God is, there is the good Conſcience; where it is wanting Conſcience cannot be good. Where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>enlivening Spirit</hi> is abſent, or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is no life, or vegetation, or ſenſe, or reaſon, or motion; but all death, darkneſs, coldneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So where the enlivening <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> is wanting to the ſoul, there is no life, ſenſe, motion, comfort, but all is dead within, and all the works are but dead works. But where the Spirit is, there is life, there is light, there is liberty, and there is purity, there is peace, and there is grace, there is comfort and there is Conſcience, there is indeed all. <note place="margin">2 Subſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means.</note>

Where faith is pure, the Conſcience is pure: this makes the good, and mends the bad Conſcience. Faith and good Conſcience are made one for the other, as the woman and the man to be fellow-helpers each to other. <hi>Faith</hi> is Conſciences <hi>Keeper, Conſcience</hi> again is <hi>Faiths:</hi> Theſe two like <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his <hi>Armour-bearer,</hi> may diſcomfit a whole Hoſte <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> of <hi>Philiſtins;</hi> when they keep together, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hard for them to undertake; or like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> lovely in life, and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in death. Faith and good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do many a good office each for other, and are forced to unite in a league offenſive and defenſive: <hi>In an offenſive league,</hi> as <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> Jud. 1. 3. the one muſt help the other to expell the <hi>Canaanites</hi> out of his Coaſt firſt, and then proceed to expell them out of the others Coaſts after: Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience helps to expel the <hi>Canaanites</hi> of <hi>fear, diſtruſt,</hi> and <hi>deſpair</hi> out of <hi>Faiths coaſts,</hi> and to ſlay <hi>Sheſhai, Ahiman,</hi> and <hi>Talmai,</hi> theſe <note place="margin">Jud. 1. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Faith is the white <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter-box,</hi> in which Conſciences pretious Oyntment is put; Faith is the <hi>bottle</hi> into which the wine of good Conſcience is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: So again, Conſcience doth as much for Faith; Faith is the <hi>light,</hi> good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Faiths <hi>lanthorn;</hi> the lanthorn <hi>ſhews forth</hi> the light within, the lanthorn <hi>defends</hi> the light from winds and weather without, that it be not blown out: Conſcience <hi>holds forth</hi> the light of Faith to be ſeen of men; Conſcience <hi>defends</hi> faith that it be not put out. Faith is the <hi>Apple</hi> or ſight of the eye, Conſcience is the <hi>eye-lid;</hi> no eye-lid can ſee, or doth it profit the body at all without the ſight within; nor can the eye ſee long, if it have not the eye-lids to defend it from Sun, duſt, ſmoak, and the like annoyances, and to keep the ſight clear. So what is Conſcience without Faith, but a blind and blundering Conſcience?

They who would ſet your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence free to the <hi>commiſſion</hi> of ſin, and yet keep it free from <hi>confeſſion</hi> and contrition for ſin, while they promiſe you liberty, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim themſelves the <hi>very ſervants of all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Scripture rule is, Job 11. 14, 15. <hi>If Iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſſe dwell in thy Tabernacles.</hi> For then <hi>ſhalt thou lift up</hi> thy face <hi>without ſpot, yea, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt, and thou ſhalt not fear.</hi> But if thou do evil, <hi>ſin will lie at the doors,</hi> not to be driven away but by <hi>repentance,</hi> and there it will lie to <hi>keep in</hi> Terror, to <hi>keep out</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If ſin and guilt have not yet come in, they lie at the door, when thou ſteppeſt out at death, they will fly at thy face, and tear out thy throat; therefore if thou loveſt thy

Conſcience well maintained reſiſts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armes ſin; ſin once entertained, and a while maintained, grows too hard for Conſcience. Take heed then of harbouring this <hi>Gueſt,</hi> or turning in to this Hoſt, ſin; it will <hi>Jael-</hi>like, after ſoft language, &amp; ſugred entertainment, in thy ſleep aſſault thee, and faſten thee to the ground. Take not in this <hi>Jonah</hi> at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though he pay his fare when he comes in, he will raiſe a ſtorm ere he be gotten out.
